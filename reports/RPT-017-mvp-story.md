# The MVP story: sixty-six missions, five arcs, one road still open to Alpha

> **Summary:** Sixty-six missions are `done` at `59f5cfa` (2026-09-08). This
> report compresses them into one narrative — what was actually built, not a
> list of cards — ahead of a planned corpus reset that will remove most of
> `missions/`'s present detail.
> **Epistemic:** What the `done` missions, read together, say happened.
> Individual mission bodies remain the primary source; this report is a
> lossy summary of them, made on purpose.
> **Pragmatic:** Read this instead of sixty-six files to understand what
> exists today. Cite the missions themselves, not this report, for any
> claim needing acceptance-criteria detail.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles · External collaborators

## Why this report exists, and why it stays open

Numen Games is about to do a **gran reseteo**: a deliberate reduction of
`missions/` that will strip most present-tense detail from the corpus and
start much of the system's operating memory close to zero. That is a good
move — it is the same "reduce uncertainty, keep only what a live question
needs" discipline `MIS-127` has been running on `decisions/`, `canon/`,
`operations/`, `reports/` and `debt/` since 2026-08-30 (see that mission's
ledger for the token-by-token accounting of each cut).

The problem a reset creates: once a `done` mission's record thins out or
disappears, the *story* of what was built goes with it — not the
acceptance criteria (nobody needs those after the fact), the narrative.
This report exists to save that narrative before the corpus does not carry
it any more.

**It stays `status: active`, not `closed`.** `STD-001` describes `reports/`
as a `closed`-from-publication series — but `scripts/lib/rules.json`, the
lifecycle the CI guard actually enforces, has no `report`-specific entry
and falls through to the default `draft → active → closed`. Enforcement
allows what the prose does not name. This report uses that room
deliberately: it is meant to be **appended to** — with dated notes, never
silent rewrites — as more missions close on the way to Alpha, and closed
only when the Oracle decides the MVP chapter is over. That is a
premise gap between doctrine and guard worth the Oracle's attention on its
own terms; it is not litigated here, only used and flagged.

**Measured at:** `59f5cfa`, 2026-09-08. Method: every `missions/MIS-*.md`
front matter parsed (`id`, `status`, `completed`, `guild`, `territory`,
`title`), template and annex files excluded. 149 mission files read; 66
carry `status: done`.

---

## The story, in five arcs

Sixty-six done missions, read by date and territory, cluster into five
arcs. Titles are exactly the missions' own; nothing paraphrased.

### Arc 1 — Bootstrap (2026-04-05 to 04-08, 11 missions)

The company got a repository, its agents got working tools, and the first
two protocols were written. `MIS-037` created the canon repository itself
(then `numinia-digital-agents`). `MIS-016` put Caddy and SSL in front of
every server service; `MIS-011` audited numengames.com. `MIS-051` and
`MIS-053` wired Gmail, Calendar, Drive and email (Khepri) into the agent
layer. `MIS-059` and `MIS-038` wrote the Context Load Protocol and the
Design Briefing Protocol — the first two things an agent was told to obey
before doing anything else. (The mission's own title still calls it
"P-007"; no live protocol answers to that id today — an unrenamed relic
of the pre-`PRO-` prefix scheme, not a citable identifier.) `MIS-057` ran the first deep QA of the whole
NWOS system. `MIS-042` and `MIS-047` gave the org a README and a standing
weekly report. `MIS-063` deployed the first public form, at `/velo`.

### Arc 2 — The archive becomes legible (2026-08-17/18, 11 missions)

Four months later, the corpus stopped being a private git tree and became
a public, English, on-brand website. `MIS-056` translated the canon to
English; `MIS-066` unified the mission system into one folder, one
language. `MIS-087` mirrored every canon document on numinia.org, `MIS-088`
made it downloadable as formatted PDF, `MIS-090` built a frozen demo
workspace so the system could be shown without burning tokens. `MIS-092`
`MIS-092` through `MIS-094` moved the whole surface onto Design System v5 — palette,
Phosphor icons, typography — commissioned by numinia.org as the consumer,
not handed down from elsewhere. `MIS-010` published the public roadmap
v1.0, `MIS-041` wrote the agent onboarding protocol, `MIS-044` published
the GAPS capability map — see `RPT-008` today.

### Arc 3 — Governance becomes visible (2026-08-25, 10 missions)

The board that tracks the work got designed as carefully as the product.
`MIS-132` and `MIS-133` reordered the Mission Board by operability and gave
mission cards a three-level hierarchy. `MIS-039` built the agent log
system. `MIS-045`
documented the CAO architecture. `MIS-091` extended the design system to
numen.games and nwos.numen.games. `MIS-110`, `MIS-111` and `MIS-114`
cleared dead nav entries, gave every corpus section a real index ordered
by certainty, and let `debt/` rejoin the build glob while an unready entry
stayed unpublished. `MIS-027` improved numengames.com itself.

### Arc 4 — The entropy-reduction line (2026-08-27 to 09-05, 20 missions)

This is the largest arc, and it is the one still running: it is the same
line `MIS-127` (still `in-progress`, not `done` — the umbrella outlives
its own child PRs) has been ruling on since 2026-08-30. `MIS-116` finished
the English translation; `MIS-064` updated `PRO-001` (then still cited as
"P-001") to Agent Briefing Protocol v2; `MIS-125` found and closed the
prefix register
gap across four series no rule knew about; `MIS-129` sent six blueprints to
the shelves their content actually belonged on. `MIS-144` retired dead
migration scripts; `MIS-145` gave every registered series a real
copy-from template (twelve of fourteen templates weren't even `.md` files
before this); `MIS-147` documented the relations between the corpus's
document genres. `MIS-062` shipped Mission System v2 (states,
sub-missions, IDs, kanban); `MIS-065` moved canon rendering to build time,
out of the code regime; `MIS-089` reordered the archive's information
architecture; `MIS-105` signed the standards governing three repositories
at once; `MIS-115` redesigned the Mission Board around what's actionable.
`MIS-117` added client-side search; `MIS-118` replaced the agent roster
with real operative definitions; `MIS-120` shipped `es-ES` as the first
additional locale. `MIS-122`, `MIS-126`, `MIS-128` and `MIS-130` are the
smaller repairs this line produces as a matter of course: a `uid` rule
that contradicted its own standard, a field-decision index so the canon
gets asked before the Oracle does, post-rename link hygiene, four dead
links in the front door. `MIS-058` and `MIS-060` are the protocol and
sync-mechanism side of the same discipline: structured human-machine
approval, and agents kept synchronized with the canonical repo.

### Arc 5 — The platform gets built (dates not recorded, 14 missions)

`numinia-web` — the product itself — is `done` in fourteen missions that
share one gap worth naming plainly: **none of them carries a `completed`
date.** `MIS-072` laid the monorepo foundations, domain model and quality
floor; `MIS-073` made the CC0 Archive browsable in five locales; `MIS-075`
reached functional parity with the original numinia.store; `MIS-076`
delivered the three pillars — La Ciudad, Assets, L.A.P.; `MIS-078` dressed
the platform (Khepri); `MIS-079` wrote the City as one scrolling
narrative; `MIS-080` turned L.A.P. into a real platform; `MIS-081` opened
the Manual and made the Archive count; `MIS-082` built the session
surface (Settings, the door); `MIS-083` opened the Oracle's admin zone
behind real sessions; `MIS-086` brought the real legal corpus into
numinia.com with a consent gate; `MIS-109` made canon filable
(frontmatter, registration, the term-divergence question); `MIS-119` let
the archive read any document aloud; `MIS-0143` integrated three new
agents — Calliope, Nimrod, Talos. **This report does not know when any of
these fourteen shipped**, only that `status: done` is asserted. That is a
data gap in `missions/` itself, not something this report can resolve by
summarizing harder.

---

## What this story leaves out, on purpose

Sixty-six `done` missions are roughly 44% of the 149 read at this commit.
The rest, briefly, so the MVP does not read as the whole picture:

- **32 `todo`**, **11 `in-progress`**, **2 `in-review`** — live work,
  covered by the board itself, not by a narrative report.
- **38 `frozen`** — 22 of them marked `cancelled` outright, 16 blocked or
  parked. The cancelled 22 are concentrated in the original commercial
  plan: `Product`, `Sales`, `Funding` and `Content` territory missions
  (34 total, only 3 `done`) include `MIS-001` — **"Define the Numinia MVP
  in one page,"** the mission that named the MVP this report is about —
  now itself `frozen: cancelled`, along with the first prototype
  (`MIS-003`), the first pricing model (`MIS-004`), the first landing page
  (`MIS-005`), and eight more of the same April cohort. **The MVP that
  shipped is not the MVP that was planned.** That is not a defect this
  report is positioned to judge; it is a fact worth the Oracle reading
  plainly rather than inferring from a missing card.

---

## The road to Alpha

The gran reseteo, when it lands, is expected to remove references and
restart most of `missions/` close to zero — the same reduction discipline
Arc 4 above has already been running, taken to a larger scope. This
report is written to survive that: its claims are sourced to commit
`59f5cfa` and to the missions themselves (recoverable from git history
even after a card is gone), and it is meant to grow — one dated section,
never a silent edit — as the corpus keeps moving from this MVP toward
Alpha. When the Oracle judges that transit complete, this report closes
(`status: closed`) as its own final entry, not before.

## 2026-09-08 — The reset lands: 70 `done` missions deleted, this report is their record

Dated addition, v0.2.0. Nothing above is rewritten.

**What was done.** Under `ADR-040` (a `done` mission may be deleted) and
`ADR-030` (four tests), every `status: done` mission in `missions/` was
deleted in two batches: 16 in PR #286, and the remaining 54 in the PR that
carries this note. `missions/` goes from 133 files to 79; `done` goes to 0.
Each deleted identifier is listed in this report's `absorbs:` front matter,
so `scripts/check-references.mjs` resolves any citation of it to this
document, and each public address (`/missions/mis-NNNN` and its `/misiones/`
alias) 301s here from `web/astro.config.mjs`. The mission bodies remain in
git history at `2677f01` and earlier.

**Oracle instruction.** The Oracle ruled on 2026-09-08 that the reset takes
priority over per-citation rewriting: all `done` missions are removed, and
the places that mention them keep their mentions, resolved by `absorbs:`.
That is `ADR-030`'s reachability clause served by the resolver rather than by
editing 65 living files — a reader following `MIS-056` lands on the text
that now contains its story. Where a living document carried a markdown
*link* to a deleted file (a path, not an identifier), the link was replaced
with a plain identifier, because a path cannot be absorbed.

**Four missions this narrative did not cover.** `MIS-136`, `MIS-137`,
`MIS-139` and `MIS-140` were closed in PR #284, *after* v0.1.0 of this
report was written. They are deleted with the rest. Their closures, checked
against the tree before deletion:

- `MIS-136` — corrected the DEUDA-404 comment in `web/astro.config.mjs`.
  **Verified true** (the comment at line 24–25 reads as claimed).
- `MIS-137` — claims `scripts/requirements-tools.txt` pinning `reuse==6.2.0`
  and a CI step. **Neither exists** in `main`, in any branch, or in any
  commit (`git log --all -S`).
- `MIS-139` — claims two legacy manual references repointed in
  `numinia-web`. **Not done**: the decisions log (line 111) and
  the onboarding report (line 23) in `numengames/numinia-web` still carry the
  retired name.
- `MIS-140` — claims `scripts/check-published-coverage.mjs` and a CI step.
  **Neither exists** anywhere in the repository's history.

Three of the four `done` closures in #284 assert evidence the tree does not
hold. They are recorded here as *claimed, not delivered*, so that the debt is
not lost with the cards: the `reuse` pin, the publish-coverage guard and the
`numinia-web` repoint remain open work for the Alpha, unowned by any mission
file until one is written.

**Measured at:** `2677f01` before the deletion. `missions/` 133 → 79;
`done` 54 → 0; `todo` 32, `in-progress` 7, `in-review` 2, `frozen` 38
unchanged.

## 2026-09-08 — The frozen shelf goes too: 38 missions that were decided against, or never got started

Dated addition, v0.3.0. Nothing above is rewritten.

**What was done.** On the Oracle's instruction, the 38 `status: frozen`
missions were deleted in the PR that carries this note. `missions/` goes
from 79 to 41; `frozen` goes to 0. What remains is live work only: `todo`,
`in-progress`, `in-review`. Their identifiers join this report's `absorbs:`
and their addresses 301 here, as with the `done` batches. Bodies remain in
git history at `3a71b0b`.

**Why this needed a rule change.** `PRO-003` §2 said of a cancelled
mission: *"keeps its file, `frozen` with the reason. Never deleted."*
`ADR-040` deliberately left that standing — a cancelled mission has no
successor document to carry its resolution into. This section *is* that
document: the record of what was decided against, and why, survives here
in one table instead of thirty-eight files. `PRO-003` is amended in the
same PR (`ADR-040` v1.1.0, dated note) so the protocol and the tree agree.

**The 22 cancelled — the plan that did not ship.** Every one carries
`freeze_reason: cancelled`; all but three were written on 2026-04-07, the
day the company drafted its first commercial plan. They are the MVP that
was planned and replaced by the one that was built (see *What this story
leaves out*, above): the one-page MVP definition, the paying-user map, the
navigable prototype, monetisation v1, a landing page with lead capture, a
Cal.com onboarding, a 5-user pilot, a pitch deck, a content strategy, a
funding memo. On the infrastructure side: CI/CD, monitoring, Umami, a
stack document — replaced by the archive-first line Arc 2 to 4 describe.
Nothing here is a loss the Alpha needs to recover; it is the record that
the question was asked and answered *no*.

**The 16 parked — blocked on something the repository does not hold.**
These were not decided against. Each was frozen because its next step
lived outside this repo: a Sales owner the Oracle has not named (`MIS-017`,
`MIS-019`, `MIS-023`), a channel decision never written (`MIS-028`,
`MIS-029`), a grant cycle that passed (`MIS-031`), a sponsor or funding
model never decided (`MIS-033`, `MIS-034`), a dashboard target that was
retired (`MIS-040`), hardware in transit (`MIS-052`), numinia-web work on
the wrong shelf or copy the Oracle has not written (`MIS-074`, `MIS-077`),
a domain renewal date (`MIS-084`), an external repository and a CAN-005
ruling (`MIS-106`, `MIS-108`), and one folded into `MIS-096` (`MIS-068`).
The trigger for each is recorded in the table so that, if the Alpha meets
it, the question can be re-opened as a new mission — not by restoring the
card.

| ID | Territory | Title | Freeze reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIS-017 | Sales | B2B Prospecting Pipeline (50 leads) | no owner and no live Sales channel; unfreeze when the Oracle names one |
| MIS-019 | Sales | Sequential outreach to 20 prospects | waits on MIS-017 having an owner; a 3-touch sequence with no prospect list is not executable |
| MIS-023 | Sales | Initial Case Study | no client case exists yet; unfreeze when one does |
| MIS-028 | Content | Founding Newsletter / Mailing list | no owner and no channel decision recorded; same family as MIS-005 |
| MIS-029 | Content | Community on Discord or Telegram | its own criterion 1 asks for a community-channel DEC that was never written; unfreeze when it is |
| MIS-031 | Funding | Final review of the Arbitrum grant | wallet address never provided and the grant cycle passed; the Oracle decides whether the grant is still pursued |
| MIS-033 | Funding | Identify 10 Web3/Gaming sponsors | no owner, no citer, no channel; the sponsor model was never decided |
| MIS-034 | Funding | Angel investor deck v1.0 | no funding round open; same ruling as MIS-020 |
| MIS-040 | CAO | CAO dashboard: KPI definition | targets the retired pablofm.com dashboard; re-brief against numinia.org/missions (which already shows mission KPIs) to unfreeze |
| MIS-052 | Infrastructure | On-premises infrastructure — Dedicated PC | waiting on hardware delivery — the PC in transit; unfreeze when it exists |
| MIS-068 | CAO | NWOS propagation: consumer repos never drift from the source of truth | folded into MIS-096 on 2026-09-02: its two surviving criteria (inventory of propagating artefacts; reporting guard) moved there; this file stays as the diagnosis record |
| MIS-074 | Platform | Progressive identity (Web2→Web3) for numinia.com | numinia-web work (Session Zero ranks) parked on the wrong shelf; nothing executable from numinia-nwos |
| MIS-077 | Platform | Data dignity: Numinia vs today's internet | numinia-web copy the Oracle has not written; nothing an agent of this repo can start |
| MIS-084 | Platform | numinia.store → numinia.com: SEO migration and legacy shutdown | parked by Oracle order 2026-08-16; the numinia.store renewal date is the trigger |
| MIS-106 | TBA | The mould carries a retired name: the template still calls the system Khepri | blocked on an external repository and an Oracle ruling (CAN-005 §7 on the name) |
| MIS-108 | TBA | Offer the mould its own provenance: the template still calls itself the source | blocked with MIS-106 — same external repository, same ruling |

**Measured at:** `3a71b0b` before the deletion. `missions/` 79 → 41;
`frozen` 38 → 0; `todo` 32, `in-progress` 7, `in-review` 2 unchanged.
