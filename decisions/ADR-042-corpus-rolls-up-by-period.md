# ADR-042 — The corpus rolls up weekly

> **Summary:** Ratifies `STD-012` (the rule) and `PRO-017` (the procedure);
> amends `ADR-030` so a period roll-up is a written resolution; amends
> `CAN-001` with the principle *a system that only adds is not contained*.
> **Epistemic:** The record of the most important lesson of April–September
> 2026: the archive grew faster than anyone could read it.
> **Pragmatic:** Closed records leave the corpus every week without the
> Oracle's hand.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

## 2. Decision

1. `STD-012` is ratified: three levels (weekly, quarterly, annual); git is
   the daily; a line survives if it changed a rule, opened or closed a debt,
   or produced an address; identifiers resolve to the highest living level.
2. `PRO-017` is ratified and mandatory: the weekly roll-up runs every Monday
   before the Dark Council, by any agent.
3. `ADR-030` test 3 accepts a period report that carries the record's line.
4. `CAN-001` gains one paragraph under *Numinia's Rituals*: the Dark Council
   opens with the roll-up; a contained system forgets on schedule.
5. `debt/` and `blueprints/` follow the same exit as `missions/`: a line,
   then deletion. `decisions/` do not roll up; their deflation is rules
   moving into standards.

## 4. Consequences

- `DEF-002` has no guard: `period` is not read by any script. Recorded here,
  not as a `DBT-` file; it closes when a guard reads it.
- `RPT-017` stays closed for growth; `RPT-018` is the alpha's index of
  weeks, not its narrative.
