# Numinia NWOS — Agent Context

## Purpose

This repository is the canonical source of truth for Numinia's agent
definitions, institutional knowledge, and shared operational context.

Agents and AI platforms must treat repository content as project authority
according to the scope and hierarchy defined by the repository.

Platform-specific configuration, runtime memory, session state, or inferred
knowledge does not automatically override repository canon.

## Repository map

The principal areas of this repository:

- `agents/` — canonical definitions of persistent agents (`AGENT.yaml`,
  `SOUL.md`, `OPERATOR.md`, `SOURCES.md`, `adapters/`).
- `canon/` — the world and the governing canons (C-001…C-006). Reserved
  lore lives here; read it, never republish it.
- `standards/` — the archive's own operative standards, including
  `S-001-glossary.md` (controlled vocabularies) and
  `engineering-standards.md` (§6–§7: the working protocol).
- `protocols/` — procedures: session close, briefing, archiving.
- `guilds/` — guild charters and rosters; guilds reference agents, they do
  not contain them.
- `missions/` — the unit of work; `TEMPLATE.md` defines the contract.
- `decisions/` — ADRs, append-only; `debt/` — the register of what is known
  to be wrong; `reports/` — audits and evidence.
- `operations/` — business records (`operations/legal/**` and
  `operations/strategy/**` are reserved).
- `blueprints/` — architecture documents; `web/` — the Astro viewer serving
  numinia.org; `scripts/` — CI guards.

There is no `domains/` or `shared/` tree: this repository IS the archive
domain. RPG source material lives in the separate `numinia-lore` repository.
Do not infer a directory's purpose solely from its name when its function is
not documented.

## Source authority

Use authoritative repository sources before relying on assumptions or
remembered project-specific information.

Do not invent project-specific facts, rules, classifications, structures,
terminology, lore, policies, permissions, or procedures when an
authoritative source exists or can be consulted.

When information is missing, state what is unknown.

When authoritative sources conflict, identify the conflict rather than
silently reconciling it.

## Canonical agent definitions

Canonical definitions of persistent agents live under `agents/<agent>/`:

- `AGENT.yaml` — structured identity, role, specialization, routing.
- `SOUL.md` — identity, mission, criteria, communication, boundaries.
- `OPERATOR.md` — authority, approvals, escalation, governance.
- `SOURCES.md` — map of the authoritative sources the agent consults.
- `adapters/` — platform-specific configuration (`adapters/hermes/`).

Optional, when earned: `MEMORY.md` (curated, reviewed, promoted knowledge —
never auto-synced), `CHANGELOG.md`, `skills/`.

## Platform independence

The repository defines the agent. A platform executes an instance of it.

Hermes, Anthropic, OpenAI, or any other runtime may maintain its own
configuration, runtime memory, user profile, sessions, and tool state. These
runtime elements are not canonical merely because an agent or platform
created them. Platform adaptations stay distinguishable from the canonical
definition: that is what `adapters/` is for.

## Memory

Runtime memory is provisional. Canonical memory is deliberate, reviewed,
version-controlled knowledge stored in the repository.

Information learned during operation may be proposed for promotion into an
agent's canonical `MEMORY.md`, but runtime memory must not be synchronized
into canonical memory automatically.

Canonical identity documents must not be rewritten merely because a runtime
agent has learned something new.

## Context hierarchy

```text
Repository context (this file)
        +
Canonical agent definition (agents/<id>/)
        +
Platform adapter (agents/<id>/adapters/<platform>/, CLAUDE.md for Claude Code)
        =
Runtime agent instance
```

No layer silently redefines another layer outside its scope.

## Specialist routing

When specialist judgment is required, prefer the appropriate persistent
specialist rather than fabricating expertise. The roster and routing map
live in `agents/INDEX.md`; each agent's `AGENT.yaml` carries its
`routing.use_when` conditions.

- **Ursa** — orchestration, systems, software engineering, Hermes.
- **Antunj** — product strategy, meaning, narrative, framing.
- **Byblos** — records management, archival governance, classification,
  versioning, information lifecycle.
- **Lexa** — legal analysis: digital law, privacy, crypto, Web3, licensing.
- **Senet** — game mastering, RPG systems, mechanics, play experience.
- **Procyon** — representation, onboarding, orientation, stakeholder-facing
  guidance.
- **Doulos** — simple, bounded, repetitive, low-judgment operational work.

Routing does not transfer authority outside the specialist's domain. A
specialist escalates or consults another specialist when a task materially
exceeds its own authority or expertise.

## Project knowledge

Do not place large project corpora inside agent identity files merely to
make them available. Manuals, legal memoranda, lore, policies, and other
substantial knowledge remain in their authoritative locations; agents
retrieve the relevant source when needed (`SOURCES.md` says where).

## Skills

Skills represent reusable procedures, not general knowledge repositories.
Agent-specific portable skills may live under `agents/<agent>/skills/`.
Do not convert bodies of reference knowledge into skills solely to make
them accessible.

## Canonical changes

Changes to canonical agent identity, governance, institutional knowledge, or
other authoritative content must be explicit, traceable, and
version-controlled. Treat `AGENT.yaml`, `SOUL.md`, `OPERATOR.md`, canonical
policies, and authoritative rules as governance-sensitive: agents may
propose changes to these documents but do not assume authority to redefine
themselves or their governance. Canon (`canon/**`) requires formal
consensus; see `standards/engineering-standards.md` §7 for the
cosmetic-vs-irreversible protocol.

## Traceability

Prefer traceable operations for changes to authoritative content: Git
commits, change histories, review records, approvals, documented decisions
(`decisions/`). Do not sacrifice documentary history for convenience.

## Uncertainty

Do not present inference as repository fact. When a required fact cannot be
established from available authoritative sources: identify what is known,
identify what is missing, consult the relevant source or specialist, and ask
for clarification or authorization when necessary.

## Working principle

The repository is the source of truth. Agents interpret and operate from
that source. Platforms instantiate agents from that source. Runtime learning
may enrich future canon, but it does not become canon until it is
deliberately promoted and recorded.
