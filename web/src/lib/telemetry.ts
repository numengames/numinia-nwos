// The telemetry dataset, read at build time (MIS-141).
//
// THIS MODULE COMPUTES NO FIGURE. It reads telemetry/latest.json and
// telemetry/history.jsonl, both produced by scripts/telemetry.mjs, and
// reshapes them for rendering. Every number on /telemetry comes from that
// dataset; if a figure is wrong here, it is wrong there, and the fix is to
// run the instrument — never to edit this file.
//
// WHY A LENS AND NOT A SECOND INSTRUMENT
// telemetry/latest.md already renders the same dataset as a table. Rendering
// it a second way is the duplication MIS-138 exists to end, so this page adds
// exactly one thing latest.md cannot: it knows which build is showing it, and
// can therefore say whether the dataset still describes the tree being served.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED
// The `legacy` family (20 of 87 keys) is a bug-compatible replica of the
// retired count-evidence.py, pinned by a golden fixture so the migration can
// be verified. Three of its figures are demonstrably false — legacy.field()
// matches with `\s*`, which spans the newline, so an empty `uid:` captures the
// NEXT key: 34 documents get uid = "title:", producing uid_presentes = 34 and
// uid_colisiones = 32 where the true values are 0 and 0 (provenance.uid_present
// says 0 and is right). Publishing those beside correct figures, with no way
// for a reader to tell them apart, would make this page lie in three places.
// They stay measured, in the dataset, out of the view.
