//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// On 2026-08-25 the Workers Builds Git connection had silently dropped and
// production served a seven-day-old build. Nothing on the page said so, and
// telling "today's deploy" from "the one from a week ago" took ten minutes of
// probing URLs. A build that cannot say what it is forces that every time.
//
// NEITHER VALUE IS WRITTEN BY HAND.
//   version -> web/package.json, read at build time
//   sha     -> WORKERS_CI_COMMIT_SHA, injected by Workers Builds
//              (developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/
//               "system environment variables ... injected by default")
//
// Local builds have no SHA. That is normal, not an error: it degrades to "dev"
// rather than failing the build, because a developer running `astro dev`
// should not need CI variables present.

 * Link from a rendered page back to the file it was rendered from.
 *
 * Every page here is a view of a markdown file that lives in the repo; the
 * repo is the original and this is the copy. A reader who wants history,
 * blame, or the raw source should be one click away from it, not left to
 * guess the path.
 *
 * Astro's `entry.filePath` is relative to the web/ project ("../canon/CAN-001…"),
 * but that prefix is an implementation detail of where the site sits inside
 * the repo. Anchoring on the known top-level folders instead survives a move:
 * whatever comes before them is dropped.
 *
 * Returns null rather than a wrong URL when the path is not recognised — a
 * broken link into GitHub is worse than no link.
