// One page, one h1.
//
// Every document in this repo opens its sections with `# `, because in a
// markdown file the document IS the page and that is correct. Rendered on the
// site it is not: the page already prints the title as an <h1>, so C-001
// arrives with ELEVEN of them. A screen reader announces eleven documents in
// one page and a search engine has to guess which title is the title.
//
// This shifts every heading in rendered document bodies down one level, so the
// markdown's `#` sections become the <h2>s they are on a web page. The source
// files are untouched: the defect is in the rendering, so the fix lives here.
//
// h6 is the floor -- HTML has no h7, and a document nested that deep has a
// structure problem no plugin should paper over.
