// std-010-licensing — the guard of STD-010.
//
// The human-readable `license:` frontmatter field is not an SPDX tag:
// REUSE.toml is the declaration of record. A document whose header names a
// licence other than the regime REUSE.toml assigns to its path is
// contradicting the record, and that drift is how a wrong default keeps
// reappearing across templates. Frontmatter only: licence strings inside
// fenced code examples are content, not declarations, and are ignored.
//
// templates/ is skipped here and checked harder elsewhere: a mould's
// `license:` is a worked example of the series it scaffolds, so it must
// carry the DESTINATION's regime while the mould's own path is CC0.
// Comparing a mould against its own path would demand the answer that makes
// every document copied from it wrong. check-templates (T-04) resolves each
// mould's destination directory and checks the regime there.
//
