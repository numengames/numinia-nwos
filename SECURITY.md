# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security issue in this repository or in the site it
deploys (`numinia.org`), please report it privately:

- **Email:** legal@numengames.com (subject line starting with
  `[SECURITY]`)
- Please do **not** open a public issue for security reports.

We will acknowledge your report within 7 days. There is currently no
bug bounty programme.

## Scope

- This repository (`numengames/numinia-nwos`): the NWOS workspace and
  the Astro viewer in `web/`.
- The deployed site: `numinia.org` / `www.numinia.org` (Cloudflare
  Workers, static assets only — the viewer holds no secrets and needs
  none to build or run).

## Out of scope

- Third-party services we rely on (GitHub, Cloudflare) — report to
  their own programmes.
