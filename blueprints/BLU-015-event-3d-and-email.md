## 1. Physical event

Credential in Diurno legible at 1.5 m; badges with name+symbol+color; signage legible at 10 m without depending on color; reusable supports, low-consumption inks.

## 2. 3D and metaverse

Canonical normal map as PBR material (Three.js); Ámbar as warm key light, Turquesa as cold fill; objects carry their rarity in material + label, never emissive alone.

## 3. Email

Body in level I or III, plain text or minimal HTML; no decorative images. **Signature:** name in Sans 600 · role in tertiary · contact in Mono, each datum on its line; no logo as an attached image (the wordmark only if the email client supports it inline); a single link in color, the rest in ink.

## Check

After the general checklist of `PRO-014` §4, and before delivering:

- [ ] Event: credential legible at 1.5 m, signage at 10 m, neither depending on colour.
- [ ] 3D: low-poly register (`CAN-008`), flat palette colour, no photographic textures; Ámbar key + Turquesa fill; rarity in material + label, never emissive alone.
- [ ] Email: level I or III, no decorative images, one coloured link, no logo as attachment.
