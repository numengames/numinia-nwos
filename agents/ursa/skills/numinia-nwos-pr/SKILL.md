# numinia-nwos PR cycle

The repository is the only source of truth. A chat summary, a compacted
context or a memory note is background, never a plan: re-measure the tree
before acting (`git fetch && git log -1 origin/main`, `gh pr list --state open`).

## Modes

- **Unattended** (the Oracle says "desatendido"): open the PR, watch
  `gh pr view N --json state` in the background, and on `MERGED` take a fresh
  `main` and open the next one. **Never self-merge**: merging is the Oracle's
  signature (`AUT-006`).
- **Unattended covers the normative axis only** — standards, protocols,
  decisions. **Canon is out**: it is `governed`, it has other authors, and each
  canon cut is discussed in conversation *before* a branch exists. A proposal
  written inside the PR body does not count as discussion.
- A phase the Oracle declares ("solo ideas", "no implementar") is binding.

## Cycle — one PR is one cut

1. `git checkout main && git pull && git branch -D <old-branch>`. Read and
   measure the document and its citers: `grep -rn <ID> --include=*.md`, plus
   `web/src/lib/corpus.ts`, `web/astro.config.mjs`, `REUSE.toml`,
   `scripts/*.mjs`.
2. Write the document. Keep the original header fields (`guild`, `territory`,
   `threshold`, `supersedes_record_of`, `license`); bump from the version that
   is actually in the file; keep the SPDX comment equal to `license:`.
3. `git checkout -b <series>/<id>-shape`.
4. `node scripts/check-document-shape.mjs --write-baseline` — the list only
   shrinks.
5. Guards, all of them: `check-document-shape`, `check-references`,
   `check-internal-links`, `lint-frontmatter`, `check-frontmatter-yaml`,
   `lint-naming`, `check-section-citations`, `check-license-frontmatter`,
   `check-templates`; then `cd web && npm run build` and
   `node scripts/check-url-lifecycle.mjs`.
6. Commit with `-c user.name=Ursa -c user.email=ursa@numinia.org` and a long
   message that says what went out and where it now lives.
7. **Telemetry last**: `node scripts/telemetry.mjs && git add telemetry` in its
   own commit; `node scripts/telemetry.mjs --check` must report OK on HEAD.
   Never regenerate before an amend (`RUP-005`).
8. `git push -u origin <branch>`; `gh pr create --base main --body-file`;
   `gh pr edit N --add-reviewer PabloFMM,Christian-Numen,MariaGarciaJordan`;
   `sleep 80; gh pr checks N`.

## PR body

Base SHA · before/after table on `DOC-00x` · what went out and where it lives
· what was *not* done · a `Verified` line with every guard's figure · `Next`.

## Pitfalls

- Force-push is not available from the agent's environment: open a `-v2`
  branch from fresh `main` and close the old PR as superseded.
- `git stash` / `stash pop` puts a `git rm`'d file back into the index and
  `check-license-frontmatter` fails with ENOENT. Run `git rm --cached` again.
- `check-references.mjs` reserves `DEC` as a legacy id prefix: never mint
  `DEC-NNN` plates.
- `check-section-citations` also walks active reports (`RPT-017`). When
  sections are renumbered, either keep the cited number (say why in the
  heading) or correct the citing report in place with a patch bump.
- Deleting a document: `absorbs:` line in the current weekly `RPT`; redirects
  for `en`/`es` and legacy slugs in `astro.config.mjs`; remove it from the
  curated order in `corpus.ts`; re-point living citers to the concrete plate.
  Closed records (`done` missions, old ADRs) are photographs (`CIT-053`) and
  stay as written.
- The shape baseline counts **form** failures only; budget overruns are
  reported, never baselined. Report both figures.
- Plates migrated from `CORE-NN` keep their number under the new prefix.
