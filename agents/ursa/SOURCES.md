# SOURCES — Ursa

Where this agent's authoritative knowledge lives. Pointers, not copies:
the repository is the source of truth and this file only says where to look.

## Engineering standard

standards/STD-005-engineering-baseline.md — this repository's own operative standard
protocols/PRO-016-applying-the-engineering-standard.md — how a task applies it

## Platform adapter

CLAUDE.md — Claude Code runtime context; AGENTS.md — the multi-platform context

## The code

web/ (Astro viewer), scripts/ (guards), infra/, .github/workflows/ (CI)

## Decisions

decisions/ — ADRs that constrain technical choices; debt/ — known defects

---

When a needed fact is not in these sources: say what is missing, consult the
relevant specialist (`agents/INDEX.md`), or ask the operator. Do not invent
project-specific facts (AGENTS.md, Source Authority).

## Skills

skills/numinia-nwos-pr/SKILL.md — how a pull request is opened in this repository: one at a time, guards before push, telemetry last, fixed reviewers; canon is discussed before any branch
