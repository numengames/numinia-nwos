# MIS-145 — Triage the ten Dependabot advisories on main and close DBT-007

> **Summary:** GitHub reports **10 vulnerabilities on the default branch —
> 3 high, 4 moderate, 3 low** — a number that exists only in the `git push`
> banner and nowhere in the corpus. This mission enumerates each advisory
> with package, severity and reach, gives each a verdict (patch, accept with
> reason, or not applicable), and closes `DBT-007`.
> **Epistemic:** whether the repository's security surface is real exposure
> or static-build noise — measured, not assumed (DBT-007 refuses to state
> the counts as measured; this mission measures them).
> **Pragmatic:** the number stops being a banner that scrolls past; the
> corpus gains a dated record of what was triaged, decided and why.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

## Origin

`debt/DBT-007-dependabot-advisories-untriaged.md` (active, severity medium).
Its own "What would close it" block is the contract this mission executes:

- [ ] The 10 are enumerated with package, severity, and whether they reach
      built output or stop at dev/build dependencies
- [ ] Each has a verdict: patch, accept with reason, or not applicable
- [ ] The accepted ones carry a reason and a date, like the orphan allow-list
- [ ] A decision on whether advisory state is surfaced anywhere the corpus
      can see it, rather than only in a push banner

The count comes from GitHub's push banner (10 · 3 high · 4 moderate ·
3 low) and is **unverified** — the counts may have changed since 2026-08-25.
The first act of execution is to re-measure from the live source.

---

## Scope

Triage the Dependabot advisory state of **this repository only**
(`numengames/numinia-nwos`), on `main`:

- enumerate the open advisories from the live source (GitHub security
  advisory API / Dependabot alerts — not from the banner or memory), with
  package, GHSA id, severity, and whether the affected dependency reaches
  built output or stops at dev/build time;
- produce a verdict per advisory: **patch** (a fix exists and is safe to
  apply now), **accept** (with a written reason and date), or **not
  applicable** (no real exposure — e.g. dev-server-only path on a static
  build);
- for any `patch` verdict that requires a dependency bump: apply the
  minimal bump (patch-level, same major), run the build and the test
  suites, and commit with a conventional message citing this mission;
- record the triage in the corpus (a dated record — report or annex) so the
  advisory state is visible to the corpus, not only to a push banner;
- close `DBT-007` per its contract, with the Oracle's sign-off.

**Where it stops:**

- **No Astro major upgrade.** Astro 5 → 7 is explicitly excluded from all
  current work (DBT-007 §"Why it is registered" point 2). If an advisory is
  only fixable by a major upgrade, the verdict is **accept with reason**,
  not an upgrade.
- **No CI-side automation** (D-017): Dependabot auto-merge, scheduled
  scanning, or guard wiring are out of scope. The decision on whether
  advisory state should be *surfaced* in the corpus is in scope (recorded);
  *automating* it is not.
- No other repositories (`numinia-web`, `numengames-web`,
  `nwos-deploy`) — even if they share dependencies.
- No dependency audit beyond the advisories themselves (no "while we're
  here" upgrades).

## Out of scope

What someone would reasonably expect to be included and is not:

- **Fixing every vulnerable dependency regardless of cost.** The mission
  fixes what is safe to fix now; everything else gets a reasoned verdict.
- **The Astro 7 migration** — that is a separate, explicitly-excluded work
  stream.
- **Other repos' dependency state.**

## Acceptance criteria

> Every criterion must be FALSE at the base commit (`db37686`). Assert the
> final state, not a delta. Verifiable by someone who did not do the work.

- [ ] A dated triage record exists in the corpus (reports/ or the mission
      annex) enumerating **every** currently-open advisory on `main` —
      package, GHSA id, severity, reach (built output vs dev/build) — and
      the count matches the live source at the time of execution.
      (today: no such record exists; the count lives only in the push
      banner and is unverified)
- [ ] Every advisory in the record carries a verdict: `patch`, `accept` +
      written reason + date, or `not applicable` + written reason.
      (today: zero advisories have any verdict anywhere)
- [ ] Each `patch` verdict that required a dependency change is backed by a
      commit whose build and test suites pass, citing this mission.
      (today: no such commits exist)
- [ ] The mission records the decision on surfacing advisory state in the
      corpus (surface in a report/feed, or deliberately not, with reason).
      (today: no decision exists; the banner is the only surface)
- [ ] `DBT-007` is updated to reflect the triage outcome (verdicts,
      remaining accepted exposure, closure recommendation) — status change
      to `done`/`closed` is the Oracle's call, not the executor's.
      (today: DBT-007 is active with zero progress)
- [ ] No dependency was upgraded beyond patch-level same-major without a
      written reason, and no Astro major upgrade was performed.
      (today: trivially false — nothing was upgraded at all)

## Execution log

*(one line per significant step: date · step · evidence)*

- 2026-09-02 — Draft registered (MIS-145) by Ursa, at the Oracle's
  request, converting `DBT-007` into a mission. Branch
  `missions/mis-145-dependabot-advisories-triage` from `main` `db37686`.
  Status `todo`; not assigned, not executed. Next free mission number
  verified against the remote (MIS-144 claimed by
  `mission/MIS-0144-scripts-cleanup`).
