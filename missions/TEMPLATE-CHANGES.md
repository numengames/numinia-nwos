# The mission template, v2 — what changed and why

> **Summary:** the template was rebuilt against the 106 missions in the repo.
> **Epistemic:** every change here carries the figure that decided it. Nothing
> was retired on taste.
> **Pragmatic:** what to fill in, what to omit, and what no longer exists.

## The finding that ordered the redesign

**The template omitted exactly the four fields the build verifies, while
declaring two that nothing uses.**

| Field | In missions | In the Zod schema | In the old template |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `guild` | **106 / 106** | yes | **no** |
| `effort` | **106 / 106** | yes | **no** |
| `area` | **104 / 106** | yes | **no** |
| `type_execution` | **88 / 106** | yes | **no** |
| `executor` | 1 / 106, **0 useful** | no | yes |
| `divergence_log` | 6 / 106, **0 useful** | no | yes |

This is not a list of fields to adjust. **It is a mould pointing at the wrong
place**: it described a system that does not exist and ignored the one that
does. A mission written strictly to the old template failed the build.

---

## The frontmatter core: the ten fields the build checks

`web/src/content.config.ts` declares a Zod schema for the `missions`
collection: `id`, `title`, `status`, `priority`, `effort`, `guild`, `area`,
`type_execution`, `assigned_to`, `completed`.

They are the core because **they are the only part of this template with a
mechanism**. A missing or mistyped field fails `npm run build`. Everything
else in this document — including all three body sections — is convention.

`type: mission` is added: not in the schema, but every document in the archive
declares its type (`S-001` §5).

### Retired, with figures

```bash
for c in executor divergence_log mission_id; do
  echo "$c: $(grep -lE "^$c:" missions/MIS-*.md | wc -l) of 106"
done
```

| Field | Figure | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `executor` | **1 appearance, 0 useful** in 106 | Duplicates `assigned_to`. One mission carries it and it is empty. |
| `divergence_log` | **6 appearances, 0 useful** in 106 | Always `null`. What it wanted lives in `## Closure`, as prose. |
| `mission_id` | **58 of 106, identical to `id` in 58/58** | Verified: zero cases where they differ. Two names for one value. |

---

## The body: three sections

**`Scope` · `Acceptance criteria` · `Closure`**

### `Story` → optional, replaced by `Scope`

`Story` is at 80% and `Scope` at 11 organic uses — and the higher number is the
weaker argument. `Story` is at 80% because the template imposed it; `Scope` is
at 11 because people wrote it **without being asked**.

`MIS-109`, the best-executed mission in the repository, **has no `Story`**. For
a small technical mission the ágil form obliges inventing a fictional persona
to say *"take `debt/` out of the glob"*.

`Story` stays available for product missions and anything with a real user.

### `Execution Reality` → `Closure`

**16 uses against 7.** `S-001` §2.1.1: the practice is the record, the template
is the claim. When they disagree, the practice wins.

What `Execution Reality` asked for is kept **inside** `Closure` — what was done
differently from the plan and why. The heading changes; the content that
produces knowledge does not.

### The five headings, and the instrument that was wrong

The first measurement said **Execution Reality: 20% of closed missions**, which
reads as *"nobody closes their missions"*. **That conclusion was false, and it
would have produced the wrong redesign.**

The control: of the 25 closed missions without `Execution Reality`, **18 record
their closure under a different heading**.

```
16  Closure (2026-08-17)      6  Real execution      5  What shipped
 7  Execution Reality         3  Premisas verificadas
```

**Only 7 of 34 closed missions leave no closure record at all.** The promise was
not being broken — the heading the template proposed was the least used of the
five.

**A reader opening an old mission should know that a different heading does not
mean different content.** The five are historical variants of the same section;
`Closure` is the canonical name from now on.

### `Context` → frontmatter, not a section

Used 12 times as a dated heading (`Context (2026-08-18)`). It is data — when the
premise was last checked — so it becomes an optional field.

---

## `Epistemic value`: optional, and with a method

At **38% in closed missions**. Mandatory in a one-afternoon mission it becomes
filler, and filler trains people to skip sections — the same mechanism as an
allow-list entry that outlives its case.

So: **only when the mission claims it learns something**, and then with a
hypothesis and how it is validated. An epistemic value with no method is an
intention.

## What did not come in

`Mission_Template_v0_2_0.md` and `Definition_of_Done_v0.2.0.md` live in
`numinia-web/docs/`, not in this repo. The DoD has **14 checkboxes**, and they
are the acceptance criteria of a TypeScript codebase: *"`packages/*`: 100%
statement coverage"*, *"`npm run verify` green"*, *"no `any`, no `console.*`,
components ≤ 200 lines"*, *"every interactive element carries `data-metric`"*.

**None of the 14 can be ticked on a documentary mission.** A template whose
boxes nobody can tick trains people to skip boxes, and from there no box means
anything.

What v0.2.0 got right — the hypothesis with a validation method — is kept, as
an optional section rather than a mandatory one.

Note: both files carry a version in the filename, which `S-001` §9 marks as a
naming violation (`S-001:1015`). This template does not repeat that pattern: it
stays `missions/TEMPLATE.md`, and git carries its history.

---

## Pending, not debt

**The 106 existing missions are not touched**, not even to normalise them. The
new template governs the ones that come. Normalising 106 documents is a mission
of its own, and it should be weighed against what it would produce: the five
closure headings are already documented above, so a reader is not lost without
it.

### The precondition, written so it can fire

That mission opens **when the template is stable, not before**. Stability is
not a feeling, so it has a falsifiable definition:

```
stable = 5 missions written with this template, with the template
         unchanged across all five
```

`git log --follow --oneline missions/TEMPLATE.md` since the fifth mission was
created must show **no commit**. One edit to the template resets the count to
zero.

**If you are reading this with the condition met and the normalisation mission
still unopened, that is inertia, not a decision** — the same clause that took
`D-032` out of `restricted-oracle` the day its condition was met.

**Counter reset once, on 2026-08-25**, by the v1.1.0 review below. It is the
only reset: from here the template is frozen until the five missions exist.

# v1.1.0 — the 2026 state of the art, filtered through what we measured

A report on agent task formats (A2A v1.0, Symphony's skeleton, Atlassian's
agent-ready ticket data, agent boards) was reviewed on 2026-08-25.

**The report is input, not authority.** Our measurement of 106 missions
governs. Two filters applied to everything in it: it must not contradict what
was measured, and its adoption cost must be proportional to small, frequent
missions. The report supplies the reason for that filter itself — Symphony's
500% rested on months of prior repo preparation, and the failure mode it names
is choosing a tool before defining the contract. **The contract is this
document.**

## What came in

**1 · Criteria must be false at the base commit.** A criterion that already
passes before the work starts graduates nothing. Written into the template
beside `Acceptance criteria`, with one good and one bad example. Zero cost.

It is our own rule — *a guard nobody has watched fail is not verified* —
applied to acceptance criteria.

**2 · The brief is not rewritten at closing.** From ClawTrol's separation of
brief and result, adapted to File Over App: no extra table, just the rule that
`Scope` and the criteria are written when the mission opens and are **not
edited afterwards**. The outcome is added in `Closure`.

Editing the brief to match what happened deletes the divergence — and the
divergence is the knowledge. Written in both places it could be broken:
under `Scope`, and in the `Closure` preamble.

**3 · `paths` as an optional field.** Repo paths the executor starts from, so
it does not scan everything. Commented in the optional block, described as a
hint and not a fence.

**4 · Title as verb + object + result.** A one-line guide in the template, not
a rule. *"Retire the /print/ intermediates from the served site"*, not *"Print
pages"* — a noun is not a mission.

**5 · NWOS ↔ A2A state mapping, as a declared table.** **Nothing is renamed.**
`status` is consumed by the Zod schema, the site paints with it, and 106
missions use it. Renaming means touching `content.config.ts` and the whole
corpus, and is forbidden here. The table exists so future interoperability is
an adapter, not a migration.

Source: `a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/life-of-a-task/`, read 2026-08-25 —
interrupted states `input-required`, `auth-required`; terminal states
`completed`, `canceled`, `rejected`, `failed`.

| NWOS `status` | Missions | A2A `TaskState` | Fit |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `draft` | 4 | *(none)* | **No A2A equivalent.** A2A tasks begin at `submitted`; a task that exists but has not been submitted is outside its model. |
| `backlog` | 40 | `submitted` | Approximate. `submitted` implies an agent has received it; our backlog implies nobody has. |
| `in-progress` | 9 | `working` | Direct. |
| `in-review` | 6 | `input-required` | Direct in mechanism — the task is interrupted pending a human. |
| `done` | 34 | `completed` | Direct, both terminal. |
| `cancelled` | 0 | `canceled` | Direct. Spelling differs (A2A uses one `l`); note it before any adapter is written. |
| `frozen` | 13 | *(none)* | **No A2A equivalent.** Neither terminal nor interrupted: the work is deliberately parked, not waiting on input. A2A's closest, `rejected`, means the agent refused it — not the same thing. |

**Two of our states do not map, and that is a finding, not a gap to fill.**
`draft` and `frozen` cover **17 of 106 missions (16%)**.

> **They do not map because A2A models a task in flight and we model a document
> that exists before and after any execution. That is not a hole — it is the
> difference between an execution protocol and an archive.**

Do not "fix" this mapping by forcing the two states into A2A's vocabulary. A
file-based archive keeps states a message protocol does not need: a document
that has not been submitted to anyone (`draft`) and one deliberately parked
rather than waiting on input (`frozen`). A2A's nearest neighbour for the second,
`rejected`, means *the agent refused it* — a different claim entirely.

### The two details that break an integration at week three

Worth more than the table itself, because both look like nothing until they
cost a day:

**1 · Spelling.** A2A writes `canceled` with one `l`; we write `cancelled`. An
adapter that string-matches will silently drop the state.

**2 · Terminal is not terminal here.** A2A terminal states cannot restart —
*"any subsequent interaction must initiate a new task"*. Our `done` missions
**have** been edited after closing (`S-001` §2.0: 9 of 33). Under `closed`
thresholds that is form and not substance, but **an adapter must not present a
NWOS `done` as an immutable A2A terminal state**, because it is not one.

## What was rejected, and why

A rejection without a reason gets reopened in a month.

| Rejected | Reason |
|---|---|
| **`exit_criteria` field** | Duplicates `Acceptance criteria`. With the falsifiability rule, the acceptance criteria **are** the exit criteria. One concept, one place. |
| **`max_turns`, `escalate_to`** | Runtime orchestration, not mission document. `requires_oracle_approval` already covers the escalation we have. Revisit when a real orchestrator exists. |
| **`protected` per mission** | Our protection is structural, not per-card: workflows never (`D-017`), thresholds per folder (`S-001` §2.1), CODEOWNERS when it arrives. A per-mission field invites believing protection is declared on the card — and the card is written by anyone. |
| **An external board as the source of state** (Vibe Kanban, Agent Kanban, Hermes Kanban, Linear) | The board exists: `missions/` is the source of truth and `/missions` is its projection. File Over App. Adopting one now is exactly the error the report opens by naming — tool before contract. **This rejects a board that *holds* state, not a viewer that *reads* it:** a read-only view over `missions/` is another projection of the same source, exactly as `/missions` already is, and is not rejected. The distinction matters because the first replaces the archive and the second cannot. Not work for now — `/missions` is the viewer that exists, and synchrony comes before improving it. |
| **Promotion to standard (`C-00X` / `S-NNN`)** | A standard exists to be adopted by other repos; `S-003` showed the correct genesis. That day comes **after** the stability criterion is met. A one-day-old standard is not a standard. |

## Known risk, not debt

The report's Symphony data on prompt injection applies here: **missions are
public, and the agent reads them in order to execute them.** That is `F-48` in
our own house.

**No template field fixes this.** A field declaring "this mission is trusted"
is written by whoever writes the mission, which is the same surface. Recorded
as a known risk of this class of system, referencing `F-48`. No debt opened.
