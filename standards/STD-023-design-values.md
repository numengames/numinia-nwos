# Design values

> **Summary:** Every closed list of the design system, as values: the
> sixteen colours and their contrasts, the type scale, the space scale, the
> icon subset, the brand inventory, the fourteen animations, the sky and the
> pixel grids. The kit `packages/design-kit/` carries the same values as
> tokens; where they differ, the generator fails.
> **Epistemic:** What the values are. Why they are what they are is
> `CAN-008`; what a builder must do with them is `STD-008`.
> **Pragmatic:** Look a value up here or in the tokens file; never in a
> piece.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

## 1. Palette

| Hex | Name | Thread | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `#A6DAD5` | **Verdemar** | Solar | Confirmation, calm, surface tints |
| `#018EA1` | **Turquesa** | Cyber | Interaction: links, focus, accents (the action fill is its shadow `#017C8D`, the button recipe in `BLU-009`) |
| `#EFA517` | **Ámbar** | Solar | Emphasis, value, achievement; the scarab's sun |
| `#F9EBDC` | **Arena** | Solar | Main neutral |
| `#F35059` | **Coral** | Cyber | Warning, real time; flash, never ambience |
| `#D33440` | **Grana** | — | Critical, gravity |

## 2. Neutrals

**Nocturno** (screen, default): background `#14110F` Noche · surface `#1E1A17` Basalto · elevated `#292420` dark Bronce · lines `#241F1B` / `#3A332D` · text `#F9EBDC` (16.1:1) / `#C4B5A6` (9.6:1) / `#8A7D72` Ceniza (4.7:1).
**Diurno** (print, long document): paper `#F9EBDC` · surface `#FDF6EE` · line `#E2D3C2` · ink `#14110F` (15.8:1) / `#4A423B` (8.6:1) / `#6E6259` (5.1:1).

**Tertiary rule [learned by auditing]:** the contrasts in this table are against the **base background**. The Nocturno tertiary drops to 4.3:1 over surface and 3.8:1 over elevated: **inside surfaces, the minimum is the secondary**; the tertiary lives only over the base background.

**Diurno semantic tints** [DERIVED — canonical formula: 12 % of the accent over paper]: confirmation `#EFE9DB` · warning `#F8D8CC` · critical `#F4D5C9` · interactive `#DBE0D5` — all with ink ≥13.6:1 on top. For status bands in documents and light product. They replace the old tint `#E4F2F0`, retired as an orphan and as the Diurno's only cold-clinical note.

## 3. Text variants over light

The canonicals are *mood* colors; over Arena, as text, the variant is used: Turquesa→`#016E7D` (5.1:1) · Grana→`#B02330` (5.8:1) · Ámbar→`#7A5100` (6.0:1) · **Verdemar→`#1F6B5F` (5.4:1)** — success can finally be written over light. **Coral has no variant and that is a decision, not an oversight:** a coral-text would be a perceptual twin of grana-text and would break the warning/critical separation. The warning over light is composed by rule: a Coral fill chip with Noche ink, or icon + text in ink.

## 4. Rarity scale

Categorical layer for game and product (objects, rewards, Navigation Charts, digital assets). An MMO convention any player recognizes without a manual, tuned to this palette and verified:

| Rarity | Nocturno | vs Noche | Text in Diurno | vs Arena | Coherence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Poor** | `#F9EBDC` | 16.1 | `#6E6259` | 5.1 | = Arena: the poor is the paper |
| **Common** | `#8A7D72` | 4.7 | `#5A4F45` | 6.8 | = Ceniza, the existing neutral |
| **Uncommon** | `#8FC46B` | 9.2 | `#356C19` | 5.4 | Warm green, Verdemar's sibling |
| **Rare** | `#5D9BD6` | 6.4 | `#2E6BB0` | 4.7 | Tempered blue, distinct from the interactive Turquesa |
| **Epic** | `#A98BE0` | 6.7 | `#6B44B8` | 5.7 | Purple softened to the warm world |
| **Legendary** | `#EFA517` | 9.0 | `#7A5100` | 6.0 | **= Ámbar**: the legendary and the achievement are the same sun |

**Why color never goes alone, with first and last name:** under protanopia and deuteranopia, epic and rare collapse — the purple loses its red and lands one step from the blue (verified by simulation). The progressive border and the written name are not courtesy: they are the channel that keeps working when color fails.

Rules: full scale and in order, no invented steps. **Progressive treatment beyond color**: poor/common border `linea.tenue`; uncommon/rare border of its color at 40 %; epic full border; legendary full border + halo `0 0 12px rgba(239,165,23,.25)` — **the system's only glow**. Name written in `type.etiqueta` the first time per view. It lives in product and game; NEVER in corporate communication: a price is not epic and a deadline is not legendary.

## 5. Píxel-16 palette

Sixteen colors, **zero new hexes**: seven neutrals, the six brand colors and three already-defined shadows, plus the rarity green. Every sprite and every pixel scene MUST limit itself to this index.

| Nº | Hex | Name | Origin | Role in pixel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `#14110F` | Noche | nocturno.fondo-base | Background, sprite outline |
| 02 | `#1E1A17` | Basalto | nocturno.superficie | Deep shadow |
| 03 | `#292420` | Dark Bronce | nocturno.elevada | Shadow |
| 04 | `#3A332D` | Bronce | nocturno.linea-fuerte | Mid shadow, metal |
| 05 | `#8A7D72` | Ceniza | nocturno.terciario | Working grey |
| 06 | `#C4B5A6` | Veiled Arena | nocturno.secundario | Mid light |
| 07 | `#F9EBDC` | Arena | brand | Light, highlight, base sprite |
| 08 | `#A6DAD5` | Verdemar | brand | Solar accent |
| 09 | `#018EA1` | Turquesa | brand | Cyber accent |
| 10 | `#016E7D` | Deep Turquesa | text-over-light | Shadow of 09 |
| 11 | `#EFA517` | Ámbar | brand | Gold, achievement, sun |
| 12 | `#7A5100` | Toasted Ámbar | text-over-light | Shadow of 11 |
| 13 | `#F35059` | Coral | brand | Living signal |
| 14 | `#D33440` | Grana | brand | Deep red — **fill only** |
| 15 | `#B02330` | Deep Grana | text-over-light | Shadow of 14 |
| 16 | `#8FC46B` | Verde | rareza.poco-comun | Nature, the solarpunk garden |

**Dominance:** ≥ 60 % of the surface in neutrals 01–07. **Dialogue subset** (pixel text over Noche, ≥ 4.5:1 verified): Arena 16.1 · Verdemar 12.2 · Veiled Arena 9.4 · Verde 9.2 · Ámbar 9.0 · Coral 5.5 · Turquesa 4.8 · Ceniza 4.7. **Grana stays out of dialogue** (3.9:1): fill yes, text never.

## 6. Functional ramps

The palette is single, but work happens through **shared ramps**. A ramp adds no colors: it orders the existing ones so that different materials appear to belong to the same world.

| Ramp | Available colors | Main use |
|---|---|---|
| **Mechanical neutral** | Noche · Basalto · dark Bronce · Bronce · Ceniza · veiled Arena · Arena | structure, stone, metal, clothing, general volume |
| **Solar** | Toasted Ámbar · Ámbar · Arena | sun, reward, lit brass, point of value |
| **Cold signal** | Deep Turquesa · Turquesa · Verdemar | interaction, energy, glass, technology in the service of life |
| **Warm signal** | Deep Grana · Grana · Coral | damage, alarm and real time; Coral and Grana still do not coexist in one composition |
| **Garden** | Verde · Verdemar · Arena | vegetation and living matter |

Each material SHOULD resolve with **2–4 colors** from one or two ramps. Sharing a shadow or a light between materials coheres the scene and preserves the limited character of 90s graphics.

## 7. Data palette

Intelligence reports are product: charts have canonical color. Like the ramps, this palette **adds no hexes: it orders the existing ones**.

| Series | Categorical order | Verification over Noche (graphic object ≥3:1) |
|---|---|---|
| 1–6 | **Turquesa → Ámbar → Verdemar → Grana → Verde → Ceniza** | 4.8 · 9.0 · 12.2 · 3.9 · 9.2 · 4.7 ✓ |

**Sequential** (magnitude): Noche → Deep Turquesa → Turquesa → Verdemar → Arena. **Divergent** (two poles): Grana ↔ Ceniza ↔ Turquesa. Rules: maximum **6 series** per chart (more series = another chart); every series with a direct label or legend, never color alone; in Diurno, series use their text variants where they exist and lines thicken to 2 px; rarity never colors data — a datum is not epic.

---

## 8. Type scale

Scale 1.200, base 16 px; pt for the 1920×1080 canvas: `display.xl` 4.300rem/50pt · `display.l` 3.583/42 · `display.m` 2.986/34 · `titulo.l` 2.488/28 · `titulo.m` 2.074/24 · `titulo.s` 1.728/20 · `cuerpo.l` 1.440/17 · `cuerpo.m` 1/14 · `cuerpo.s` 0.875/12 · `etiqueta` 0.750/11 (Mono 500, small caps, tracking `+0.10em`) · `dato.xl` 2.986 Mono 500 · `dato.m` 1 Mono 400. Display weights 500, titles 600; display tracking `-0.03/-0.02em`.

## 9. Space, grid, shape, elevation, focus


**Spacing** base 4 px: `4·8·12·16·24·32·48·64·96·128` (`space.100–1000`); every gap MUST be from the scale.
**Grids**: web ≤1280 / 12 col / margin 64 / gutter 24; tablet 8/40/24; mobile 4/20/16; slide 1920×1080 / 12 / 120 / 32; A4 12 / 20 mm / 5 mm. Baseline 8 (4 mm printed). Rhythm: sections `s900` web · `s800` deck; blocks `s700`; headline→body `s400`; card `s500`.
**Shape [CANON — direction decision, 4.0.0]**: two radii and nothing more — **control `6px`** (buttons, fields, chips, toggles) and **frame `8px`** (cards, panels, dialogs, canvases, status bands). Warm without fashion: the frame rounds a little; the content inside inherits no radius of its own. Circle only in markers, avatars and stickers; the pill is a capsule. **The pixel register keeps its straight edges** (the pixel does not curve) and printed tables too. Borders 1 px.
**Elevation**: in Nocturno no shadows — surface step + hairline (`base→superficie→elevada`); sole exception the legendary halo. In Diurno a single shadow `0 1px 2px rgba(20,17,15,.08), 0 8px 24px rgba(20,17,15,.06)`.
**Focus**: `outline: 2px solid #018EA1; offset 2px`, always visible, never animated. Non-negotiable.

## 10. Icon weights


`regular` **by default** (16–40 px) · `fill` active or reached state · `bold` at < 16 px · `light` illustrative at ≥ 48 px · **`thin` forbidden** (it disappears over Noche) · **`duotone` forbidden** (it breaks the flat discipline).

## 11. The icon subset


**The house subset [CANON — audited in production, 5.0.0].** Of Phosphor's ~1,500 glyphs, the organization uses **twenty-six**, self-hosted in `packages/ui/src/icons/` and served as inline SVG with `currentColor`. This is the vocabulary, not a sample of someone else's catalogue: `archive · bell · book-open · caret-down · caret-left · chart-bar · download-simple · flame · flame-light · gear · github-logo · globe-hemisphere-west · globe-hemisphere-west-light · house · magnifying-glass · moon · moon-stars · music-notes · package · sign-out · sun · sword · sword-light · user · users · x-logo`. Expanding it is a decision, not an oversight: a new icon enters the subset with its concept declared.

## 12. Brand inventory

All normalized to `fill="currentColor"`, in `/assets/`.

| File | What it is | viewBox | Canonical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Khepri_Logo.svg` | Brandmark: the scarab | 75.44×75.53 | Closing, favicon, avatar, seal |
| `Khepri_NG_Logo.svg` | Brandmark + NG | 75.44×75.53 | Compact with attribution |
| `NG_Logo.svg` | Monogram | 113.37×50.29 | < 120 px wide |
| `Numen_Games_Horizontal_Word.svg` | Horizontal wordmark | 382.79×28.09 | **Main signature** |
| `Numen_Games_Vertical_Word.svg` | Stacked wordmark | 180.74×73.25 | Square/vertical formats |
| `Numen_Word.svg` | «numen» | 180.74×28.09 | When «games» is evident |
| `Numinia_Word.svg` | The world | 194.25×28.01 | **Only** Numinia pieces |
| `pixel/khepri-sprite-24.png` | Canonical scarab sprite | 24×24 px | Pixel register; the brand's only pixel translation |
| `pixel/moneda-12.png` | Ámbar coin (corrected to the Solar ramp) | 12×12 px | The register's example object; tokens, rewards |
| `pixel/moneda-giro-12x4.png` | The coin's turn sheet | 48×12 px · 4 frames | Canonical reference cycle: 200 ms · steps(4) · stable volume |
| `pixel/cartografo-24.png` | The Cartographer | 24×24 px | Reference character of the `PRO-014` section 6.9 pipeline; status [EXTENSION — validate] |
| `pixel/guia/` | Didactic how-yes / how-no pairs | 16×16 px ×1 and ×8 | Production-guide material; not game assets |
| `fonts/PixelifySans-Variable.woff2` | Pixel typeface | variable 400–700 | Dialogue and display of the pixel register |
| `marca/glifo-space.svg` | *Space* glyph (the wordmark's n) | 31×29 | Brand play (`CAN-008`, the glyphs): the space, the territory |
| `marca/glifo-people.svg` | *People* glyph (n + dot) | 31×39 | Brand play (`CAN-008`, the glyphs): the person |
| `marca/glifo-connect.svg` | *Connect* glyph (the final ɑ) | 29×29 | Brand play (`CAN-008`, the glyphs): the connection |

Selection: horizontal by default → vertical in square → NG under 120 px → brandmark for closing/avatar. `Numinia_Word` never signs corporate communication.

## 14. The animation catalogue — fourteen, and no more


| # | Animation | Specification | Where yes | Where no |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **01** | **Typing** — the flagship [CANON]: text letter by letter with a block cursor, heritage of graphic adventures and 90s terminals | `22 ms/character`, linear; block cursor in Ámbar | Hero headlines, lore revelations (level II), product loads | Long body, functional interface, level III, print |
| 02 | Reveal on approach | `320 ms` · ciclo; opacity + 8 px rise, on entering the viewport, once | Content upon being discovered | Controls; re-firing on scroll |
| 03 | Signal sweep | `8 s` linear infinite; Turquesa band traversing the binary | **Maximum one per view** — the ambient cyber dose | Several at once; over reading text |
| 04 | Elevation | `120 ms` · ciclo; climbs one surface step, **no displacement** | Surface hover | Any position movement |
| 05 | Legendary pulse | `2.4 s` ease-in-out **× 2**; the halo breathes | Only the moment of obtaining; afterwards, static halo | Ambient loop; other elements |
| 06 | Lunar phase | **Loading [cadence corrected in 5.0.0]**: full cycle of the **eight phases** — quarters included — at `1,400 ms`/phase with fade ≤ `240 ms` (one turn ≈ 11.2 s). At 900 ms the quarters could not be read: **a phase that gives no time to be recognized is not a phase**. The shape is computed — fixed limb + elliptical terminator —, not swapped drawings: that way the moon truly grows. **Real progress and reading**: only waxing phases, from new to full — finishing is a full moon | Long loads, real sequence progress, reading progress of a long document (this very guide demonstrates it) | Waits < 2 s; full cycle on progress (waning while advancing confuses) |
| 07 | Waiting dots | `900 ms` · steps(3); `Cargando···` | Loading buttons | Running text |
| 08 | Block cursor | `1 s` · steps(2) | Accompanying the typing or an active field | Loose, decorative |
| 09 | Orchestrated moment | Headline typing + reveals staggered at `80 ms` | The piece's entrance — one per piece | Repeated; on every section |
| **10** | **Surfacing** — knowledge comes out of the fog [5.0.0] | `560 ms` · ciclo; opacity 0→1 + `blur(8px)→0` + 8 px rise; on entering the viewport, once | Velo register: archive, Summa, sheets upon opening, revelations | Functional interface; long lists (reveal 02 suffices); Diurno; corporate Umbral |
| **11** | **Crystallization** — the glass materializes [5.0.0] | `320 ms` · ciclo; `backdrop-blur 0→12px` + border 0→50 % + opacity | Velo panels and modals (`BLU-009`) | Outside the Velo; over backgrounds without atmosphere |
| **12** | **Page turn** — **RETIRED in 5.1.0 (H5)** | 5.0.0 registered it "to be verified against the LAP"; verification came back empty: the codex does not animate the page turn — the only living thing in that view is the Trazo (13). The number is not reused (append-only catalogue); if someday the paper turns pages with animation, it will enter as a new piece with its own specs | — | — |
| **13** | **Trazo** — the corners draw themselves [5.0.0 · in production] | `1.6 s` · ease · `stroke-dashoffset: 340 → 0`; four engraving frames staggered at `120 ms` | Book cover and chapter opening (`PRO-014` section 6.12) — it **is** that view's orchestrated moment | Interface; re-firing on scroll; alongside another orchestrated moment |
| **14** | **Sky** — the Velo's background breathes [5.0.0 · in production] | Drift of `±0.06 px`/frame with reappearance on the opposite side + alpha oscillating between `.05` and `.85` at its own rhythm (`.002–.006`) | Background of the Velo register (the sky, below) — **the only sanctioned exception** to the ambient-loop veto | Over long reading; with parallax; reacting to cursor or scroll |

The first three 5.0.0 pieces (10–12) are **transitions, not loops** and **invent no durations**: they reuse `duration.largo` (560) and `duration.medio` (320). The **trazo** (13) arrives measured from production with its own `1.6 s` — it is the catalogue's only new duration, and it is justified because drawing four corners faster turns them into a blink. The **sky** (14) is the only sanctioned exception to the ambient-loop veto (DSN-012): it is authorized because it is the **register's background**, not a view's ornament — and that is why it reacts to nothing. The codex's **reading moon** is not a new animation: it is the lunar phase (06) demonstrated in production. 10–12 belong to the Velo register and the living paper; the 01–09 catalogue serves Umbral and Velo alike. The orchestrated moment remains **one per piece**. With `prefers-reduced-motion`, surfacing and crystallization appear instantly: opacity is kept, blur and displacement are removed.

## 15. The sky

The star background of `numinia.org` is not decoration: **the sky's distribution is the rarity scale** (above). Sixty of every hundred stars are common and one is legendary — whoever looks at the sky reads the same grammar they read in loot, without anyone explaining it. It is the **only sanctioned appearance of rarity outside the game**, and it is authorized because the sky *is* world: it does not color data, prices or deadlines (the rarity rule stays intact there).

| Tier | Weight | Radius | Canonical color |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Common | 60 | 0.3–1.2 px | Arena `#F9EBDC` |
| Uncommon | 25 | 0.5–1.5 px | Verde `#8FC46B` |
| Rare | 10 | 0.6–1.8 px | Tempered blue `#5D9BD6` |
| Epic | 4 | 0.8–2.5 px | Purple `#A98BE0` |
| Legendary | 1 | 1.0–3.0 px | Ámbar `#EFA517` |

Behavior (canonized exactly as it stands in production): **175 stars**; drift of `±0.06 px` per frame with reappearance on the opposite side; **alpha breathing** between `.05` and `.85`, each star at its own rhythm (`.002–.006` per frame); reseeding on resize. Hard rules: Nocturno only; **no parallax and no reaction to cursor or scroll** — it is background, not interaction; never under long reading text; with `prefers-reduced-motion` the sky stops and the stars stay fixed at mid alpha.

**Drift detected `[FIX]`:** numinia.org today draws the sky with hexes foreign to the system (`#22C55E`, `#3B82F6`, `#A855F7`, `#F97316` — Tailwind defaults). The rule is written with the canonicals of the rarity scale; the recoloring goes to the web repository roadmap.

## 16. Pixel grids

| Family | Canonical grid | Decided first | Checked at ×1 |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **Object / badge** | `12×12 px` | silhouette, orientation, interaction point | that the object is not mistaken for another in the same inventory |
| **Character / emblem** | `24×24 px` | pose, balance axis, dominant tool or feature | that action and direction read without animation |
| **Scene module** | `48×48 px` | depth, entry/exit, focus and light mass | that the focus stays visible without zoom |

- Drawing and correcting happen at **×1**; ×2, ×3, ×4, ×6 and ×8 serve inspection and presentation, not pixel decisions.
- An asset's scale is fixed at the start. It MUST NOT be drawn large to be reduced later, nor rotated with interpolation. A new scale demands a redraw on its grid.
- All anchor points — feet, object center, tool origin and dialogue box — use integer coordinates and hold across frames.
- The *hitbox* and touch zone belong to interaction, not the visual outline: it MAY be larger than the sprite to meet the `44×44 px` accessibility minimum without enlarging the drawing.
