series_change: "1.2.0 — the Check column becomes machine-checkable and `[MANUAL]` is retired. Four forms replace it, each verifiable by tools/check-register.mjs: `[AUTO: <mechanism>]`, `[GATE: <machine evidence> → <the human act>]`, and `[DEBT: <what is missing> — <owner>, <date>]`. Measured before the change: of 29 rows claiming AUTO, 7 named a mechanism absent from the tree (no gitleaks, no knip, no .env.example, no .editorconfig, no eslint config, no roadmap file, no code of conduct), and 3 rows claimed MANUAL for work a guard already did (ARC-003 std-010-licensing, AGT-002 guards/lib/naming.mjs, DEV-005 prose-in-code.test.mjs) — a hand-written register drifts in both directions. Rows now stand at 23 AUTO, 4 GATE, 27 DEBT; the summary said 52 practices for a table of 54. TRC-006 is mechanical: an unregistered rule guard never runs and the run is green for not looking. Minor under VER-022: what the register requires of its own rows changed, no practice was reversed. The retirement of MANUAL reads as a reversal (VER-023) and is left for the Oracle to rank."

# Engineering checks

> **Summary:** The 54 practices `STD-005` requires, by profile, each with its
> level and the machine that checks it. `[MANUAL]` is debt; a `[MANUAL]` row
> naming `DBT-020` is declared automatic and executed by nobody.

| Traceability | TRC-007 | Every guard declares what it does not look at, on success as on failure (`scripts/blind-spots.json`); a guard that validates what is present cannot detect what is missing | MUST | `[AUTO: scripts/test/blindness.test.mjs]` |

| Legal | LEG-001 | Making a repository public is a gated Oracle act: licence correct, REUSE green, no secrets in history, `SECURITY.md` present | MUST | `[GATE: guards/rules/std-010-licensing.mjs → the Oracle makes the repository public]` |

**ARC-006 convention.** Seven types, nothing bespoke: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`,
`chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`. Scope is the domain, lowercase, usually the
folder. Retired types (`session`, `qa`, `standards`, `canon`, `debt`, `audit`)
stay valid in old history only.

**What a repository born from the mould ships with.** OpenSSF Scorecard weekly
and on push to `main` (target ≥ 7 on public repositories; each `CLAUDE.md`
declares which checks are in scope); the shared CI workflow with coverage
thresholds as failures and a REUSE step; one presence job for `CLAUDE.md`,
`SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, CODEOWNERS, templates, `.env.example` and
About fields; local hooks that are courtesy, skippable, never the authority.
