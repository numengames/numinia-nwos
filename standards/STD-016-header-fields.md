series_change: "2.0.0 — one lifecycle for everything that is not a mission: `draft → active → withdrawn`. `closed` and `superseded` leave the status vocabulary; an heir is the field `superseded_by`, never a state (the relation model of ISO stage codes, RFC 2026 `Obsoletes:` and NIST CSRC, verified 2026-09-09). This table is the only declaration; `rules.json` mirrors it under test. Earlier: 1.0.0 — new register, split from STD-004 under ADR-043: the field tables of the three rings (old §3, §4, §7), the type and subtype vocabularies (§5), the status lifecycles (§6), the closed vocabularies (§7.2) and the meaning of each relation (§4). Rows and plates unchanged."

# Header fields

> **Summary:** Every frontmatter field the corpus accepts, by ring: its
> value, the plate `guards/rules/std-004-the-header.mjs` cites when it fails, and which
> series may carry it. A field not here fails `HDR-030`.

## Ring 1 — identity, every document

| Field | Rule | Plate |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | present; matches its series prefix, or `registration: exempt` with a reason | HDR-001 |
| `title` | present, non-empty, English (language `[MANUAL]`) | HDR-002 |
| `type` | present; in the vocabulary below | HDR-003 |
| `status` | present; in the lifecycle of its type | HDR-004 |
| `version` | present; semantic version, no `v` prefix | HDR-005 |
| `created` | present; ISO 8601 with time; midnight rejected for new documents | HDR-006 |
| `updated` | present; ISO 8601 with time; not earlier than `created` | HDR-007 |
| `license` | present; SPDX identifier; agrees with the licence manifest (`HDR-043` when absent) | HDR-008 |

## Ring 2 — provenance, every document that makes a claim

| Field | Rule | Plate |
|---|---|---|
| `author` | who wrote it, person or agent | HDR-010 |
| `owner` | who answers for it now | HDR-011 |
| `provenance` | `human` · `ai-assisted` · `ai-generated` | HDR-012 |
| `created_source` | `git:<sha>` or `declared` — where the date came from | HDR-013 |
| `created_confidence` | `exact` · `inferred` — never invented | HDR-014 |
| `requested_by` | optional; who commissioned it | HDR-015 |
| `supersedes` · `superseded_by` · `derived_from` · `absorbs` · `ratified_by` · `related` · `parent_mission` · `former_id` | resolvable identifiers | HDR-016 |

| Relation | Means |
|---|---|
| `related` | relevant; no stronger direction known |
| `supersedes` / `superseded_by` | a later record replaces an earlier one |
| `absorbs` | a later record carries the earlier reasoning; the old identifier keeps resolving |
| `ratified_by` | an authority promoted or confirmed the record |
| `parent_mission` | a bounded child of a larger mission |
| `former_id` | the identifier before a governed move |

## Ring 3 — extension by series (`HDR-030`)

| Series | Registered fields |
|---|---|
| `missions/` | `priority` (HDR-037) `effort` (HDR-038) `assigned_to` `started` `completed` `type_execution` `freeze_reason` `in_review_at` `depends_on` `parent_mission` `sub_missions` `blocked_by` `requires_oracle_approval` `human_approval_score` `paths` `context` `divergence_log` |
| `reports/` | `severity` `period` `subtype` `model` `agent` `week` `scope` `former_id` `former_id_note` `absorbs` |
| `decisions/` | `deciders` `consulted` `outcome` `decision` `absorbs` `amends` |
| `standards/` | `absorbs` `series_change` |
| `agents/` | `role` `platform` `model` `soul` `agent` · `name` `description` (portable `SKILL.md` under `agents/<agent>/skills/`) |
| `debt/` | `severity` `severity_reason` `detected` `refuted` `source_audit` `opened_by` `visibility_reason` |
| `blueprints/` `operations/` | `extraction_note` `restoration_note` |
| `blueprints/` | `semaforo` |
| `protocols/` | `applies_to` `mandatory` |
| `standards/` `canon/` | `threshold` |
| `standards/` `canon/` `protocols/` | `supersedes_version` `ratified_by` |
| all | `tags` `visibility` `guild` `territory` · `registration` `registration_reason` `registration_exemption` · `evidence_script` `evidence_head` · `related` · `uid` (reserved empty, HDR-020) |

Retired (`HDR-031`): `area` → `territory`; `blocked_reason`; the Spanish-era
keys.

## Vocabularies

| Field | Values | Plate |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | the closed list in `STD-001`, plus `agent` for `agents/` | HDR-003 |
| `type` → series | strict for registered genres; warn-only for the two general ones | HDR-017 |
| `subtype` | reports: `audit` `analysis` `proposal` `rollup` (`daily` retired, `STD-012`) · documentation: `standard` `register` `guide` | HDR-018 |
| `guild` | `Sentinels` · `Alchemists` · `Exegetes` · `Procurators` | HDR-033 |
| `type_execution` | `digital` · `biological` · `hybrid` | HDR-034 |
| `visibility` | `public` · `restricted-oracle` | HDR-035 |
| `territory` | the eight registered words | HDR-036 |

`TBA` is legal in a vocabulary field and is not double-reported; a template's
trailing comment is stripped before judging.

## Status lifecycles

The only declaration of the states a document may hold. `rules.json`
`status` mirrors this table and `rules.test.mjs` fails when they differ.

| Type | Lifecycle | Plate |
|---|---|---|
| mission | `todo → in-progress → in-review → done`, plus `frozen` (paused; returns to any state) | HDR-004 |
| everything else | `draft → active → withdrawn` | HDR-004 |

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| `draft` | written, not yet in force; binds nobody (`PRE-006`) |
| `active` | in force, or — for a report or a closed mission's evidence — published and standing |
| `withdrawn` | no longer in force. The one terminal state: whether an heir exists is said by `superseded_by`, present or absent, never by a second state (`GIT-045`) |

Retired values (`HDR-004` rejects them): `closed` — it meant "published" in
`reports/` and would have had to mean "no longer binding" in `standards/`;
`superseded` — an heir is a relation, not a state. Whether a record's body
may still change is the series' **threshold** (`STD-001`), not its status.
