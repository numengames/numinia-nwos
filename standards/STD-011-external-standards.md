series_change: "1.0.0 — the register takes the ADR-043 shape: one table, no prose. Twenty-eight rows kept, sources kept; the reading notes that carried facts become a Notes column; the three sections that explained the table are gone. Distance 0 · 1 · 2 · 3 = enforced by a tool · written, unchecked · practised, unnamed · not considered."

# External standards

> **Summary:** What the system obeys that it did not write: each standard
> once, its source, where it applies, and its distance — 0 enforced by a tool,
> 1 written and unchecked, 2 practised and unnamed, 3 not considered.
