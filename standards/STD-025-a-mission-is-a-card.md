# A mission is a card

> **Summary:** What a file in `missions/` must be: one unit of work, on the
> board before it starts, with a stated end, one executor, a closed set of
> states, and an exit through deletion, never through editing.
>
> **Epistemic:** The mission is the only place where plan and outcome sit
> side by side. Everything here protects that difference: it is the one
> thing a closed mission teaches.
>
> **Pragmatic:** Check any card against nine plates; know who may set each
> status and what stamp it carries; know when a card may leave the folder.

**Binds:** every file in `missions/`, and whoever sets a field on one.
**Does not bind:** how an agent briefs, executes or coordinates a mission —
`PRO-003`; the header fields themselves — `STD-016`; the identifier —
`STD-018`.

## Rules

**MSN-036 — Registered before executed.** Work MUST exist as a card,
committed, before any of it happens. A card written after the fact is
fiction.

**MSN-037 — Done is stated before work starts.** A card MUST carry
acceptance criteria that are false at the base commit and phrased as a
final state. Scope and criteria are not edited after opening; what
happened goes in Closure.

**MSN-041 — Read whole, never by title.** The agent reads the whole card —
deliverable, effort, criteria, dependencies, assignee — before acting.

**MSN-001 — Five states, closed.** `status` MUST be one of `todo`,
`in-progress`, `in-review`, `done`, `frozen`. It is the only state surface:
no status folder, no index, no cancelled value — a cancelled mission is
`frozen` with `freeze_reason: cancelled`.

**MSN-002 — Each state has its hand and its stamp.** `todo` and `done`
(`completed`) are set by the Oracle; `in-progress` (`started`) and
`in-review` (`in_review_at`) by the executor; `frozen` (`freeze_reason`) by
the Oracle, from any non-terminal state.

**MSN-039 — Paused says why.** A `frozen` card MUST carry `freeze_reason`.
Unfreezing returns it to `todo` and clears the reason.

**MSN-003 — One executor.** An active card MUST name exactly one
`assigned_to`, and only that agent edits it. Work that splits becomes
child cards, one per agent, ordered by `depends_on`.

**MSN-038 — A parent waits for its children.** A card with children MUST
NOT be `done` while any child is neither `done` nor frozen-cancelled.

**MSN-004 — Done is immutable; the exit is deletion.** A `done` card MUST
NOT be edited once merged. It leaves the folder under `ADR-030`'s four
tests; a `frozen` card too, once a living document records its identifier,
title and reason. Ninety days in `todo` without activity is stale: frozen
or deleted at the next review.

## Check

| Rule | Verified by |
|---|---|
| MSN-036 | manual — the card's date against the work's first commit |
| MSN-037 | manual — the section is checkable; whether it states a test is not |
| MSN-041 | manual — no trace distinguishes a read from a skim |
| MSN-001 | `web/src/content.config.ts` (build fails on any other value) |
| MSN-002 | `lint-frontmatter.mjs` — stamp present for the status |
| MSN-039 | `lint-frontmatter.mjs` — `freeze_reason` present when `frozen` |
| MSN-003 | manual — `assigned_to` is one value; who edits is judgement |
| MSN-038 | manual — parent and child are declared in prose |
| MSN-004 | `check-deletable.mjs` for the exit; the immutability is manual |

## Why

Without this, the board lies: work appears after it happened, cards drift
to match their outcome, two agents write one file, a parent closes over an
open child, and a finished card is quietly rewritten. Each plate closes one
way for a card to say something other than what occurred.
