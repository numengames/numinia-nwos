# The corpus does not grow

> **Summary:** Every record — mission, report, debt, blueprint — has a written
> exit. Records roll up by period: week, quarter, year. What survives is what
> changed a rule, opened or closed a debt, or produced an address. Git keeps
> the rest.
> **Epistemic:** Why a corpus that only adds becomes unreadable, and what a
> reader may expect to find where.
> **Pragmatic:** A deleted record's identifier keeps resolving, always to the
> highest living document that holds its line.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

**Binds:** `missions/`, `reports/`, `debt/`, `blueprints/`.
**Does not bind:** the axis — `canon/`, `standards/`, `protocols/` deflate by
consolidation (`ADR-030`); `decisions/` deflate by becoming rules, never by
roll-up.

## Rules

**DEF-001 — Git is the daily record.** No document MUST be written whose only
purpose is to say what happened today. `git log --since` is the daily report.

**DEF-002 — Three levels, not more.** Records roll up into a **weekly** report,
weekly into **quarterly**, quarterly into **annual**. No monthly level. Each is
one document in `reports/`, `subtype: rollup`, with a `period` field.

**DEF-003 — What survives a roll-up.** A line is carried up if, and only if, it
records a rule that changed, a debt that opened or closed, or an artefact with
an address — a URL, a released version, a merged PR elsewhere. Everything else
falls at the first roll-up.

**DEF-004 — The record dies when its line lands.** A mission that closes
(`done`, or `frozen` with its reason), a resolved debt, a blueprint that became
a mission or was abandoned: its line goes into the current weekly report and
the file is deleted in the same PR, under `ADR-030`'s four tests.

**DEF-005 — The identifier resolves to the highest living level.** A deleted
record's identifier goes into the `absorbs:` of the report that carries its
line. When that report is rolled up, its `absorbs:` MUST move whole into the
report above, and every public redirect MUST be repointed in the same PR.

**DEF-006 — Phase is an index, not a level.** A phase report points at the
periods that compose the phase and what they concluded. It MUST NOT restate
the weekly lines; it cites them.

**DEF-007 — The roll-up is delegable; the criterion is not.** Any agent MAY
execute a roll-up following `PRO-017`. What survives is DEF-003, not the
executor's judgement; an uncertain line is carried up and marked for the
Oracle, never dropped.

## Check

| Plate | Verified by |
|---|---|
| DEF-001 | `lint-frontmatter.mjs` — no `subtype: daily`, no one-day `period` · `[MANUAL]` for a daily in disguise |
| DEF-002 | `[MANUAL]` — no guard reads `period` yet (`ADR-042`) |
| DEF-003 | `[MANUAL]` — `PRO-017` makes the executor state which of the three |
| DEF-004 | `check-deletable.mjs --candidates` — closed records with no living citer |
| DEF-005 | `check-references.mjs` · `check-url-lifecycle.mjs` |
| DEF-006 | `[MANUAL]` |

## Why

An archive that only adds becomes, in months, larger than any reader can
hold: 133 missions and 528k tokens by September 2026, cut to 18 and 324k in
one day by hand. This standard makes that cut a rhythm instead of an event.
Three levels because each is a decision boundary; a fourth rewriting adds loss
without adding one. A document written in order to be compressed later is
inflation with a deadline.
