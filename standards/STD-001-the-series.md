series_change: "5.2.1 — 2026-09-10: status `active` → `draft` under the alpha reset the Oracle ordered on 2026-09-10: the state had been set by agents, not signed one by one. Text unchanged; the state returns to `draft` until the tree meets the standard and the Oracle ratifies it one by one. Patch move (VER-064). 5.0.0 — cut eleven under ADR-043. The glossary that was not a glossary becomes the register it always was: what series exist, what each holds, its prefix, its threshold, its budget, its mould. The rules moved to STD-024 (a series is a function), STD-021 (citing vs data), STD-015 (guard checks); the field vocabularies were already in STD-016. Section-numbered citations resolve in git."

# The series

> **Summary:** The folders of the corpus, one row each: what the folder holds,
> its identifier prefix, its change threshold, its body budget and its mould.
> **Epistemic:** Which series exist, and what each one is for.
> **Pragmatic:** Look up where a document goes and what it is called before
> creating it. An unlisted folder is unregistered until a row is added here.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

**Binds:** every tracked document of the corpus.
**Does not bind:** what a series is and what it obliges — `STD-024`; the
fields of the header — `STD-016`; the identifier — `STD-018`.

## Series

| Series | Holds | Prefix | Threshold | Budget | Mould |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `canon/` | what the system **is**: foundational, not operating policy | `CAN-NNN` | `governed` | 1500 | `CAN-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `standards/` | what an **artifact** must comply with | `STD-NNN` | `governed` | 500 (norm) · none (register) | `STD-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `protocols/` | what an **actor** executes in a repeated situation | `PRO-NNN` | `governed` | 500 | `PRO-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `decisions/` | why something was chosen; withdrawn by the next | `ADR-NNN` · `DEC-NNN` | `governed` | 500 | `ADR-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `missions/` | the work; state lives in `status:`, never in the path | `MIS-NNNN` | `closed` when `done` | 500 | `MIS-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `reports/` | what was observed on a date; `reports/evidence/` is never edited | `RPT-NNN` · `RPT-YYYY-MM-DD` (`daily`, retired) | `closed` | 1000 | `RPT-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `blueprints/` | what could be; not a report of what happened | `BLU-NNN` | `open` | 1000 | `BLU-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `debt/` | what is known to be missing; deleted once nothing living cites it | `DBT-NNN` | `open` | 300 | `DBT-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `operations/` | what sustains the business: legal, strategy | `OPS-NNN` | `open` | — | `OPS-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `system/` | how the machine is wired | `SYS-NNN` | `governed` | — | `SYS-TEMPLATE.md` |
| `agents/` | who acts: `SOUL` · `OPERATOR` · `STATUS` · `MEMORY` per agent | — | `live` (memory) | — | `agents/_template/` |

`canon/`, `standards/` and `protocols/` are the **axis**; the rest are
**registers** (`STD-024`). Budgets are the body word counts `STD-007` measures.
Moulds live in `templates/`, which is apparatus: never a member of a series,
never published, CC0-1.0.

## Genre and folder

| `type` | Series | Guard strict |
|---|---|---|
| `seminal` | `canon/` | yes |
| `documentation` (`subtype: standard` · `register`) | `standards/` | no |
| `documentation` (`subtype: guide`) | the series it explains | no |
| `protocol` | `protocols/` | yes |
| `mission` | `missions/` | yes |
| `adr` | `decisions/` | yes |
| `blueprint` | `blueprints/` | yes |
| `report` | `reports/` | yes |
| `legal` | `operations/legal/` | yes |
| `agent` | `agents/` | yes |
| `meta` | anywhere — apparatus accompanies its series | no |

Withdrawn `type` values: `audit` → `report` + `subtype: audit` · `decision` →
`adr` · `roster` → `meta`.

## Status

The states a document may hold, for every series, are declared once in
`STD-016`. A mission's stamps (`started` · `in_review_at` · `completed` ·
`freeze_reason`) are its Ring 3 fields, also in `STD-016`.

## Earlier schemes

`P-NNN` · `S-NNN` · `D-NNN` · `C-NNN` · `O-NNN` · `AUD-YYYY-MM-DD` · `AG-NNN`.
Nothing is renumbered: a document that cites one keeps the citation as a
promise about the past, and `check-references.mjs` resolves it against git.
Across repositories the identifier is qualified: `nwos:ADR-006` · `web:ADR-006`.
