# One document, one identifier

> **Summary:** Every document carries the identifier of its series, for life.
> A number once used is never reused; the filename carries neither state nor
> version; when two agents claim one number, the first commit keeps it.
> **Epistemic:** What an identifier is and is not allowed to encode.
> **Pragmatic:** Name a new document, or resolve a collision, without a
> decision.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

**Binds:** every registered document of the corpus.
**Does not bind:** the grammar of each series prefix — `STD-001`; the slug —
`lint-naming.mjs` states it.

## Rules

**IDN-011 — The identifier is permanent.** Every document carries the
identifier of its series, and that identifier never changes.

**IDN-012 — No state in the filename.** State lives in a declared field.

**IDN-013 — No version in the filename.** The version lives in a declared
field.

**IDN-014 — Numbers are never reused.** An identifier once used is not used
again, not even after the document is deleted; a rule that leaves a standard
leaves a gap, never a renumbering.

**IDN-015 — First commit keeps the number.** When two agents claim one
identifier, whoever committed first keeps it and the second renumbers.

**IDN-016 — The next number is read from the trunk.** The next free
identifier is computed over what is committed after `git pull`, never over
the working tree.

**IDN-017 — Across repositories, qualify.** An identifier cited across a
repository boundary carries the repository: `nwos:ADR-006`, `web:ADR-006`.
Within a repository the bare identifier is correct.

## Check

| Plate | Verified by |
|---|---|
| IDN-011 | `lint-naming.mjs` |
| IDN-012, 013, 014 | `check-core-rules.mjs` |
| IDN-015 | `[MANUAL]` — resolved by commit order at the moment of collision |

## Why

An identifier is an address. A citation, a redirect and a `git log --follow`
all depend on it not moving; a filename that also carried state or version
would change every time the document did, and every address into it would
break. The gap a retired rule leaves is cheaper than the renumbering that
would silently re-point every citation to the wrong rule.

## References

| ID | Title | Relation |
|---|---|---|
| `STD-001` | Vocabulary | the series prefixes |
| `STD-004` | The header | where state and version live |
| `STD-020` | Git is the archive | what happens to the address when the document retires |
