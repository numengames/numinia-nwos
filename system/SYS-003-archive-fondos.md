extraction_note: "Extracted from web/src/pages/archive/[fondo].astro and archive/index.astro (MIS-065 phase C — File over App). Document paths corrected to the post-MIS-066 flat layout (agents flat, missions flat, P-001 English); 'Archive System' has no matching file in canon/ today — kept as declared, flagged for MIS-071. The per-fondo lore lines were folded into this file's fondos[].lore under ADR-036 (2026-09-01): canon/ became CC0, so the one-file-one-regime split that justified the separate lore file no longer applied and that file was retired. Translated to English under MIS-116 (ADR-023 (formerly ADR-024)) — language only."

former_id_note: "Renumbered by MIS-129 under ADR-035: this is the reference manual of the seven fondos, not a plan. Its frontmatter also carries the live data for the /archive pages, which were repointed in the same commit."

# BP — The Archive's Fondos

> **Summary:** The Archive's taxonomy: the seven documentary fondos,
> what each contains, who governs it, and how they relate to each
> other. The data in this frontmatter feeds the viewer's `/archive`
> pages — the archive is the source, the web the lens.
> **Epistemic:** How the system's memory is organized.
> **Pragmatic:** Canonical reference for the fondos and their relations.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

## The seven fondos

| Fondo | Subtitle | Governance |
|---|---|---|
| `canon/` | Immutable Memory | Oracle only. Blocking CODEOWNERS. |
| `agents/` | Living Entities | SOUL/OPERATOR: Oracle. STATUS: the agent. |
| `missions/` | Movement | Only the executor edits their active mission. |
| `protocols/` | Operating Rituals | New version = new file. |
| `decisions/` | Crystallized Will | Append-only. Never delete. |
| `blueprints/` | Unmanifested Potential | Oracle approves the merge. |
| `operations/` | Circulatory System | Oracle modifies; agents propose. |

## Relations

```
            canon
           /     \
      agents ←→ missions ── decisions
        |      /   |
   protocols  /    blueprints
        |    /
    operations
```

The canon feeds agents and missions; the protocols ritualize both; the
operations sustain them; missions crystallize into decisions and are
born from blueprints. The exact positions and edges of the viewer's 3D
diagram live in the frontmatter (`graph:`).

## History

- v1.0.0 (2026-08-17) — Extraction from the viewer's components
  (MIS-065 phase C), with document paths corrected to the post-MIS-066
  flat layout. Each fondo's lore lives in this file's own `fondos[].lore`
  field (ADR-036 folded the retired «canon/archive-lore.md» in here when canon/ became
  CC0 and the one-file-one-regime split stopped being necessary)
  (reserved regime).
