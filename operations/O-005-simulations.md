# What happens when the Narrative Work OS meets the real world?

> **Summary:** Results study of 100 implementation simulations across 5 organizational archetypes. Critical variables, success patterns and failure modes documented.
> **Audience:** Public (page `/simulaciones` — «NWOS — 100 Simulaciones»).

**Methodological note.** This study simulates 100 NWOS implementations through a parametric model based on the previously identified gaps, change-management literature (Kotter, Prosci ADKAR), burnout theory (Maslach) and comparable adoption data for corporate culture systems. The results are modeled projections, not field data — no external organizations have implemented the system yet. This is the starting point, not the destination.

## Global results — The 100 simulations as a whole

| Outcome | Simulations | Definition |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Complete success | 29 | Sustained adoption 6+ months |
| Partial success | 31 | Core adopted, lore pending |
| Stalled | 23 | Initial enthusiasm without traction |
| Abandonment | 17 | Discarded in under 3 months |

**Reading:** Under unoptimized conditions, the NWOS has a sustained adoption rate of **29%**. Combining complete and partial success, **60%** of organizations retain at least the system's core. The remaining **40%** represents the territory where the identified gaps operate unanswered.

## By organizational archetype — The 5 profiles and their outcomes

| ID | Archetype | n | Success | Partial | Stalled | Failure | Adoption rate | Average (months) |
|----|-----------|---|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| A1 | Technical startup 5–15p | 20 | 11 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 85% | 2.8 |
| A2 | Mixed startup 15–50p | 20 | 7 | 8 | 4 | 1 | 75% | 4.1 |
| A3 | Traditional SME 50–150p | 20 | 2 | 5 | 7 | 6 | 35% | 7.3 |
| A4 | Creative agency 10–30p | 20 | 8 | 7 | 4 | 1 | 75% | 3.2 |
| A5 | Corporate team 100–500p | 20 | 1 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 30% | 9.7 |

### A1 — Technical startup 5–15p

High openness to change, tech-native language, no prior structure. The most natural profile for NWOS.

- **Main failure causes:**
  - Narrative coherence does not scale with growth
  - Ritual fatigue when the team doubles
- **Differential success factors:**
  - Organic adoption of the vocabulary
  - Digital agents integrated within weeks

### A2 — Mixed startup 15–50p

Technical and non-technical profiles. Tension between operational efficiency and the narrative layer. The most common case in 2026.

- **Main failure causes:**
  - Uneven cognitive cost across profiles
  - ICP not defined before scaling
- **Differential success factors:**
  - Rituals with real operational weight
  - Vocabulary MVP: 5 concepts in week 1

### A3 — Traditional SME 50–150p

Established hierarchy, resistance to narrative change, HR involved in every culture decision.

- **Main failure causes:**
  - Vocabulary blocked by the traditional executive profile
  - Pre-existing structural burnout left undiagnosed
- **Differential success factors:**
  - Corporate translation mode activated
  - Internal champion with real authority

### A4 — Creative agency 10–30p

High symbolic tolerance, project culture, high turnover. They adopt fast, but sustaining is the challenge.

- **Main failure causes:**
  - Narrative fragmentation with every new project
  - Emergent roles not formally recognized
- **Differential success factors:**
  - Rituals as cultural anchoring between projects
  - The Archive as living institutional memory

### A5 — Corporate team 100–500p

Budget approved by the CHRO, pilot implementation in one team. The case with the highest potential ROI and the highest friction.

- **Main failure causes:**
  - No prior external validation: the system arrives already as a conclusion
  - Digital accountability impossible without legal-HR support
- **Differential success factors:**
  - 8-week pilot with pre-agreed metrics
  - Corporate mode with Numinia out of the visible layer

## Critical variables — What moves the needle most

Success + partial rate by presence or absence of each variable. Computed over the 100 simulations.

| Variable | Success with (Yes) | Success without (No) | Comparison |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| External validation before implementing | 68% | 12% | With / Without prior external validation |
| Gradual adoption vs. full from day 1 | 61% | 21% | Gradual / Full from the start |
| Organizational health (Maslach green) | 72% | 9% | Healthy org. / Org. with structural burnout |
| ICP defined before starting | 58% | 19% | Clear ICP / Undefined ICP |
| Internal champion with real authority | 64% | 17% | With champion / Without champion |
| Corporate translation mode active | 43% | 14% | With corp. layer / Without corp. layer |

## Failure modes — How the NWOS dies (when it dies)

Frequency of each failure cause over the simulations that ended in abandonment or stall (n=46).

| Failure mode | Frequency | Cluster |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Pre-existing structural burnout, masked | 34% | C8 |
| No external validation — internal coherence mistaken for market value | 29% | C1 |
| Entry cognitive cost too high before first value | 24% | C2 |
| Ritual fatigue: format without genuine experience | 18% | C5 |
| Narrative fragmentation when scaling without a canon guardian | 16% | C8 |
| Digital accountability blocked by legal structure | 14% | C4 |
| ICP and business model undefined — nobody knows what they are buying | 12% | C3 |

## Success patterns — The 5 ways it works

Classification of the 29 successful simulations by dominant implementation pattern.

### The Controlled Pilot — 38%

8 weeks, a team of 5–12 people, pre-agreed metrics, external validation first. The pattern with the highest conversion rate to full implementation.

- **Requirements:** External validation ✓ · ICP defined ✓ · Healthy org. ✓

### The MVV (Minimum Viable Vocabulary) — 27%

Only 5 concepts in week 1. Mission, role, decision, ritual, agent. The rest of the vocabulary emerges when needed, not before.

- **Requirements:** Gradual adoption ✓ · Internal champion ✓

### Corporate Mode — 19%

Numinia as an optional deep layer. The NWOS structure with standard business vocabulary at the interface. Opens the enterprise market without sacrificing the core.

- **Requirements:** Corporate translation ✓ · Champion with authority ✓

### The Amplifier — 11%

NWOS not as a solution to burnout but as a multiplier when the organization is already healthy. Mandatory prior Maslach diagnosis.

- **Requirements:** Prior diagnosis ✓ · Healthy org. ✓ · Gradual ✓

### The Digital Native — 5%

Tech-first teams where the digital agents integrate before the rituals do. The system starts from the infrastructure and the lore arrives later.

- **Requirements:** Tech startup ✓ · High AI maturity ✓

## Conclusion

**The most important conclusion:** The NWOS does not fail because of the system — it fails because of the context it is deployed into. In organizations with basic organizational health, a defined ICP and prior external validation, the sustained adoption rate rises to **68%**. In organizations with prior structural burnout and no external validation, it drops to **9%**.

The system is an **amplifier**, not a repairer. And the sequence matters: first external validation, then gradual adoption, then narrative scale. Inverting the order turns the system's strengths into its main failure vectors.
