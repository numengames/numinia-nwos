# Credential Map

> **Summary:** Structure of credentials without real values.

Structure of credentials without real values. This document shows WHERE things live, not WHAT they are.

## Google Workspace

| Service | Account | Where configured |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Gmail | khepri@ai.numengames.com | OpenClaw config (server) |
| Calendar | khepri@ai.numengames.com | OpenClaw config (server) |
| Drive | khepri@ai.numengames.com | OpenClaw config (server) |
| Auth method | OAuth2 via gog CLI | /home/node/.config/gogcli/ |

## GitHub

| Personal access token (PabloFMM) | PabloFMM | GitHub Settings → Tokens |
| Org access (numengames) | PabloFMM | Via existing PAT |

## Infrastructure

| Service | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| VPS server | IP not documented here. **This row asserted "documented privately. Not in this repo." from 2026-04-06 to 2026-08-25; the assertion was false — see Correction record below.** |
| OpenClaw config | /home/node/.openclaw/ on server |
| Umami Analytics | Port configured via Caddy reverse proxy |
| Cal.com | Port configured via Caddy reverse proxy |

## Services in design phase

| Service | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Anthropic API key (usage) | Pending — needed for cost tracking |
| Ollama (on-premises) | Pending — when dedicated PC arrives |

*Real values are NEVER documented here. This is structure only — an intent this
document asserted while it was untrue elsewhere in the corpus; see below.*

## Correction record — 2026-08-25 (§2.1.2)

**What this document asserted.** The `VPS server` row read *"IP documented
privately. Not in this repo."* — from `84a9f71` (2026-04-06) to `392ffc6`
(2026-08-25). **141 days.**

**What was true.** The VPS IPv4 address was committed to this repository on
`e56f6e8` (2026-04-07, *"migración completa desde pablofm.com"*) and was present
in **7 tracked files**, reaching **13 built pages** and live on numinia.org at
`/agente/`, `/corpus/agents/ursa/memory/` and `/corpus/agents/nimrod/status/`.
**140 days published**, in a public repository with clonable history.

**How it was detected.** Not by a guard — none covers this. It surfaced from a
regex sweep for secret material across all 282 corpus documents while
classifying this document at the Oracle's request. The sweep was looking for
tokens and keys; the contradiction was incidental. **Nothing in the system was
watching this claim.**

**What was done.** The string was retired from the 6 `.md` files under
`fix/retire-vps-ip-from-corpus` and replaced with an explicit pointer. One
occurrence remains in `web/src/pages/agente.astro` — deliberately: it is not
`.md`, no corpus measurement reaches it, and the orphan-content guard must be
the thing that finds it. Tracked in `D-032`.

**What was NOT done, and why.** History was not rewritten. The address has been
public for 140 days and is discoverable by DNS regardless; `filter-branch` would
not unpublish it and would break every signature in the repository. The Oracle
ruled it an **identifier, not a value** — no credential was exposed and no
rotation is implied. The residual risk is aggregation: the address sat beside
host sizing, internal ports and this very credential inventory. **That control
is a network control, not a documentary one**, and is verified externally by the
Oracle.

**The general defect.** This document made a falsifiable compliance claim that
nothing falsified. It is not unique: `D-033` measures **145 such assertions
across the corpus, 132 of them unverified**.

## Version history

- v1.0.0 (2026-04-06) — Initial creation.
- v1.1.0 (2026-04-07) — Translated to English (MIS-056).
- v1.2.0 (2026-08-25) — Correction record (§2.1.2): the `VPS server` row
  asserted for 141 days that the address was not in this repository. It was.
  Assertion corrected in place, not silently; the address retired from 6 `.md`
  files. Detected incidentally, by no guard.
