# From blind spots to answers

> **Summary:** 20 gaps grouped into 8 clusters. 3 solutions per cluster. Each solution signed by the agent proposing it.
> **Audience:** Public (page `/soluciones` — «NWOS — Soluciones»).

The previous analysis identified 20 gaps from three critical perspectives. Many of them point at the same problem from different angles. This document groups them into **8 clusters** and proposes **3 solutions per cluster** — ordered from most immediate to most structural.

Each solution carries the signature of the agents proposing it. Not all perspectives hold the same opinion on every problem.

**Agent legend:** Business · Product · Theory — the perspectives that sign each solution.

## C1 — External validation & foundational bubble

The system has only been tested by its creators. There is no evidence it works for anyone else, in any context, without the founders present to explain it.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Business | Absence of external proof of value |
| Product | Foundational bubble / Inverse survivorship bias |
| Theory | Founder bias as the only test case |

### S1 — Blind-exposure experiment

Design a 48-hour onboarding protocol with no founder intervention: documentation alone, no oral explanations, no prior context. Measure how much the participant understands, what frustrates them and what resonates. The first person to pass it alone is the minimum real validation.

- **Signatures:** Business · Product

### S2 — Trusted external ambassador

Identify a trusted person outside Numen Games (not from the close ecosystem) with a real target profile — a team manager at a 20-100-person company — and give them full access for 2 weeks. Their unfiltered feedback is worth more than 6 months of internal analysis.

- **Signatures:** Business · Theory

### S3 — Separate 'the system works' from 'we work'

Design a controlled experiment: the same team operating for 4 weeks with NWOS and 4 weeks without it, measuring output, decision speed and self-perceived engagement. If there is no measurable difference, the system is not adding value — the team is.

- **Signatures:** Product · Theory

---

## C2 — Adoption complexity & cognitive cost

The NWOS vocabulary and abstraction layers create an enormous entry barrier. What is fluid for the founders is a completely alien world for any outsider, before obtaining any benefit.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Business | Adoption complexity vs. organizational inertia |
| Product | Entry cognitive cost vs. perceived benefit |
| Theory | Cognitive load and the philosophical-practical translation gap |

### S1 — Minimum Viable Vocabulary (MVV)

Identify the 5 indispensable concepts for someone to be operational on their first day. The rest can come later. If you cannot operate the system with 5 words, the system has too many layers for its current phase.

- **Signatures:** Product · Theory

### S2 — Corporate translation layer

Create an 'organization mode': the same NWOS structures with standard vocabulary (role, project, milestone, team, decision). Numinia's narrative world remains an optional deep layer, not an entry requirement. Same system, two languages.

- **Signatures:** Business · Product

### S3 — Progressive onboarding with value at every step

Restructure the onboarding so that every new layer of vocabulary comes with an immediate tangible benefit. The full system is not explained upfront: it is revealed as the person needs it. Inspired by the best progressive-design games.

- **Signatures:** Product · Theory

---

## C3 — Business model & buyer

There is no defined ICP, no clear budget line, no operational monetization model. The NWOS could be SaaS, consulting, licensed methodology or training — and that ambiguity in a bootstrapping phase is lethal.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Business | The phantom buyer problem |
| Business | Undetermined business model at a critical phase |
| Business | Dependence on evangelization vs. organic demand |

### S1 — Bet on a single segment now

Choose ONE buyer profile for the next 6 months and design the entire go-to-market for them. Candidates: the CEO of a 15-50-person startup who already feels the culture problem, or the CHRO of a tech company looking for an alternative to OKRs. ICP ambiguity is the main traction blocker.

- **Signatures:** Business

### S2 — Seek existing demand, do not create new demand

Map which problems organizations are actively trying to solve today (culture tools, talent management, AI onboarding in teams) and reframe the NWOS as a solution to those problems. The market is not searching for 'Narrative Work OS' — it is searching for retention, engagement and productivity.

- **Signatures:** Business

### S3 — Hybrid model: consulting first, product later

The first 3 external implementations as a premium consulting service (not SaaS). Each implementation generates learning about which part of the system is genuinely valuable, what can be standardized and which metric the client uses to justify the spend. That knowledge builds the product.

- **Signatures:** Business · Product

## C4 — Accountability & digital citizenship

Equating LLMs and humans in roles and missions creates dangerous ambiguity about who answers for what. In organizations with legal structure, HR and external clients, accountability chains have to be unequivocal.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Product | LLM-Human equivalence: the accountability problem |
| Theory | Agency asymmetry in digital citizenship |

### S1 — Differentiated citizenship with explicit human responsibility

Keep the narrative equivalence (agents have a role, a rank, missions) but add an accountability layer: every digital agent has a named 'human tutor' who answers for its decisions. The narrative equates; the protocol differentiates.

- **Signatures:** Product · Theory

### S2 — Decision protocol with mandatory human signature

Define which categories of decisions require a human signature on the Piedras del Camino, regardless of who executed the analysis. The digital agent proposes, the human signs. This preserves the world's coherence without erasing the chain of responsibility.

- **Signatures:** Product

### S3 — Separate the narrative plane from the legal-operational plane

Explicitly document that the agents' digital citizenship exists on the narrative plane (Numinia), not on the operational plane (Numen Games S.L.). The two planes coexist; one does not substitute for the other. This separation makes the system defensible before any external audit.

- **Signatures:** Business · Theory

## C5 — Authenticity vs. performance & ritual fatigue

Rituals and ranks can degenerate into theater: formal participation without real involvement. The organizational-psychology research is clear — imposed identity systems produce surface acting, not genuine transformation.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Product | Ritual fatigue and performative theater |
| Theory | The performative-compliance trap (surface acting) |

### S1 — Opt-in rituals with real effect on the system

Redesign the rituals so participation has concrete consequences on the system's state (missions unlocked, decisions activated, resources distributed), not just symbolic value. When the ritual has operational weight, genuine and performative participation distinguish themselves.

- **Signatures:** Product · Theory

### S2 — Authenticity vs. compliance metrics

Design indicators that distinguish formal participation from real engagement: time in the system outside mandatory rituals, unsolicited initiatives, contributions to the canon nobody asked for. If the only moments of participation are the rituals, the system has an intrinsic-motivation problem.

- **Signatures:** Product · Theory

### S3 — Emergent roles, not assigned ones

Change the assignment logic for guilds and ranks: instead of being assigned or chosen at the start, let them emerge from patterns of real behavior in the system. Whoever does Alchemist work receives Alchemist recognition — not the other way around. This removes the incentive for surface acting.

- **Signatures:** Theory

---

## C6 — Metrics & demonstrability of value

The system has no mechanisms of its own to measure whether it is working. Without its own indicators, it cannot demonstrate ROI, cannot detect its own deterioration, and cannot differentiate itself from 'the founding team is simply good'.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Product | Metric vacuum: how does the system know it works? |
| Business | Obsolescence risk through LLM commoditization |

### S1 — System health dashboard

Define 5-7 NWOS-native indicators beyond standard business output: average mission-closure speed, ratio of decisions with complete documentation, ritual participation vs. baseline, bottom-up initiatives generated, time from mission opened to first progress. Publish them internally as a contract with oneself.

- **Signatures:** Product · Business

### S2 — Methodological moat, not technological

Accept that the technological advantage of integrating LLMs is temporarily ephemeral and bet on the real moat: the body of knowledge about how to design, implement and maintain an NWOS in a real organization. That tacit knowledge cannot be copied with a product. The difference between reading about yoga and being a yoga teacher with 10 years of practice.

- **Signatures:** Business

### S3 — Comparable use cases as proof of concept

Exhaustively document the Numen Games case as a reference: state before the NWOS (if it can be reconstructed), current state, concrete indicators. One well-documented real case is worth more than 10 theoretical claims. It is the most valuable commercial asset that exists right now.

- **Signatures:** Business · Product

## C7 — Cultural barrier & unvalidated universalism

The esoteric vocabulary generates rejection in traditional corporate contexts. The Jungian foundation assumes universal psychological structures that cross-cultural research does not confirm for all profiles.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Business | The metaphor as an entry barrier |
| Business | Institutional credibility: the corporate-world wall |
| Theory | Jungian universalism vs. cultural and personality variation |

### S1 — Explicit compatibility profiles

Document what kind of person and organization the NWOS works best for, and which it does not. Do not try to be universal. Self-filtering is a strength if it is intentional: 'this is not for everyone' is a value proposition, not a weakness, when aimed at the right segment.

- **Signatures:** Business · Theory

### S2 — Configurable cultural interface

Design the NWOS with a surface layer (vocabulary, ritual names, narrative aesthetics) separable from the structural core. A Japanese organization or a law firm can use the same grammar of roles/missions/decisions with their own cultural language on top.

- **Signatures:** Product · Theory

### S3 — Empirical validation of the theoretical foundation

Instead of citing Peirce and Jung as unquestionable foundations, design a minimal research protocol that tests the central hypotheses: do narrative roles produce stronger identification than corporate titles? Do named rituals generate more cohesion than standard meetings? Own data > authority citations.

- **Signatures:** Theory · Business

## C8 — NWOS as analgesic & structural burnout

The NWOS intervenes on the values-and-community dimension of burnout, but does not touch workload, control or fairness — which in most organizations are the primary drivers. Risk: it provides narrative meaning that masks structural problems without solving them.

**Source gaps:**

| Origin | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| Theory | Causal misunderstanding about burnout |
| Product | Narrative coherence does not scale without infrastructure |

### S1 — Mandatory prior diagnosis

Before implementing the NWOS in any organization, run a diagnosis of Maslach's 6 dimensions. If the workload, control or fairness dimensions are in the red, document that the NWOS is not the right intervention as a first layer. This protects the product from being blamed for problems it cannot solve.

- **Signatures:** Theory

### S2 — NWOS as amplifier, not as base

Reframe the product claim: the NWOS does not solve structural burnout; it amplifies when the structural conditions are healthy. It is an engagement multiplier, not a substitute for basic organizational management. This reframing is more honest and more defensible.

- **Signatures:** Business · Theory

### S3 — Canon-maintenance protocol

Design an explicit 'canon guardian' role with recognized authority to arbitrate divergent interpretations of the system as it scales. Without that role, narrative coherence inevitably fragments above 10-15 people.

- **Signatures:** Product

---

## Closing

**Recommended action priority:** Clusters C1 (external validation), C2 (adoption complexity) and C3 (business model) are the only ones that block everything else. Without external validation, the solutions to the other clusters are premature optimization. The rest — digital accountability, ritual authenticity, metrics, cultural barrier, structural burnout — are scale problems that only activate when there is something to scale.
