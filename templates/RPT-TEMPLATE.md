# RPT-NNN — What was observed

> **Summary:** One sentence. WHAT was observed, and on what date it was true.
> **Epistemic:** What the system looked like on the observation date.
> **Pragmatic:** Evidence other documents may cite.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

<!-- Title: state the finding, not the exercise. "Nine guards certify a corpus
     three of them cannot read" — not "CI audit". -->

## 1. Scope and method

What was examined, what was deliberately not, and how it was measured.

Name the instrument: the command, the script, the commit. A finding whose
method is not stated cannot be re-run, and a report that cannot be re-run is
an opinion with a date on it.

**Measured at:** `<sha>`, YYYY-MM-DD.

---

## 2. Findings

What was found. Numbered, each one standing alone, each one falsifiable.

| # | Finding | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The claim, in one line | The figure and the command that produced it |

Separate what was **measured** from what is **inferred** from it. The moment
those two share a sentence, the report stops being evidence.

---

## 3. What this report did NOT examine

The border of the observation. Name the adjacent things a reader will assume
were covered and were not.

A report is read as a verdict on the whole system unless it says otherwise.
This section is the difference between evidence and false assurance.

---

## 4. Recommendations

What follows from §2 — separated from it, because a finding survives a
recommendation being rejected.

Each recommendation names the actor who would execute it. A recommendation
addressed to nobody is a wish.

<!--
NOTES ON USING THIS TEMPLATE — delete this block.

A report is `closed` once published. Its claims are NOT rewritten: a correction
is a new report that supersedes it, or an amendment note appended with its own
date. Editing a signed observation destroys the only thing the series is for.

DAILY REPORTS are the one shape that departs from this file:
  - filename  reports/RPT-YYYY-MM-DD.md   (the date IS the identifier)
  - subtype   daily
  - body      the session record — what was done, what was learnt, what broke
  - the `evidence_script` / `evidence_head` pair when figures are quoted
Everything else on this page still applies, §3 above all.

Annexes live in reports/evidence/<RPT-id>/ and are excluded from the web
corpus deliberately: the report is the published document, the annex is the
captured artefact behind it.
