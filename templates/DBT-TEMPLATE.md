# DBT-NNN — The defect

> **Summary:** One sentence. WHAT is known to be missing or wrong.
> **Epistemic:** What we lose by not knowing this — the surface a reader cannot trust.
> **Pragmatic:** What closes this entry, and what evidence would prove it.
> **Audience:** Agents

## 1. The defect

What is wrong, in one paragraph, measured. Not "documentation is incomplete"
— "37 of 150 missions carry no `completed` date, counted 2026-09-04".

State it so that someone who disagrees knows exactly what to disprove.

---

## 2. Evidence

The command, file, or observation that establishes the claim, and its output.
Dated, so a later reader knows what it was true of.

```
$ the command that measures it
the output, verbatim
```

An entry with no reproducible evidence is a suspicion. Suspicions are legitimate
— mark them `severity: low` and say in §1 that the measurement is missing.

---

## 3. Closure condition

The single sentence that, when true, closes this entry. Written as a test,
not as an intention.

> **Closes when:** the condition, stated so a guard or a human can check it
> without re-reading this document.

"Closes when the docs are improved" closes nothing. "Closes when
`node scripts/lint-frontmatter.mjs` reports zero H-31 findings" closes.

---

## 4. Cost of leaving it open

What this defect will cost if nothing is done — the reason it is registered
rather than fixed on the spot.

This section is what makes a debt register a priority list instead of a
complaint file.

<!--
NOTES ON USING THIS TEMPLATE — delete this block.

`status: active` means the debt is OPEN. `closed` means the closure condition
in §3 was met — and the entry stays in the corpus, because the record of what
was wrong is the point.

`visibility` fails closed: an entry with no field, or with anything other than
`public`, does not publish on the web. Set it deliberately.

`absorbs` is load-bearing: the reference guard reads it to keep a merged
entry's original identifiers resolving. Consolidating debt without it breaks
every citation of the entries it swallowed.

Sections 1-4 are required. §2 with no output pasted into it is not evidence.
