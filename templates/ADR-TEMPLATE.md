# ADR-NNN — The choice, stated

> **Summary:** One sentence. WHAT was decided.
> **Epistemic:** The reasoning that makes this the chosen path.
> **Pragmatic:** What changes because of this decision.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

<!-- Title: state the choice, not the subject. "Prefixes are three letters,
     not four" — not "Prefix naming". A reader scanning the index must know
     what was ruled without opening the file. -->

## 1. Context

The forces that made a decision necessary: what was measured, what broke,
what two paths could not both be taken.

State the problem in numbers where numbers exist. A context section that
argues instead of describing has already made the decision, and hides it.

---

## 2. Decision

The ruling, in the imperative, in one paragraph. Then its boundary: what it
binds, and from when.

> Write the rule so it can be quoted alone. If the decision only makes sense
> read together with the context above, it is not yet a decision.

---

## 3. Alternatives considered

What else was on the table, and the reason each was not taken. One
sub-heading or one row per alternative — never a bare list.

| Alternative | Why not |
|---|---|
| The option not taken | The cost that ruled it out |

An ADR with no rejected alternative recorded a preference, not a decision.

---

## 4. Consequences

What this obliges from now on, and what it costs. Both halves are required:
a consequences section with no cost in it was written by the advocate.

- **Obliges:** what every actor must now do differently.
- **Costs:** what becomes harder, slower, or impossible.
- **Reversal:** what evidence would justify superseding this.

---

## 5. Status

Where this record stands today, and by what.

`draft` — proposed, not binding. `active` — binding. `superseded` — replaced,
kept resolving because a decision is never deleted (`superseded_by` names its
replacement).

<!--
NOTES ON USING THIS TEMPLATE — delete this block.

A decision record is append-only. Correcting one means writing the next one
and pointing `superseded_by` at it, never editing what this one claimed.
That is the whole value of the series: what was believed, and when.

`absorbs` is load-bearing, not a note: the reference guard reads it to keep
a merged decision's original identifiers resolving. Consolidating records
without it breaks every citation of them.

Sections 1-5 are required. Sections beyond them earn their place or stay out.
