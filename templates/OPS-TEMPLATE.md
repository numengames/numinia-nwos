# OPS-NNN — The operational fact

> **Summary:** One sentence. WHAT this record sustains in the running business.
> **Epistemic:** The operational context this document captures.
> **Pragmatic:** When it is consulted, and by whom.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

<!-- Title: name the fact, not the department. "The company's fiscal identity"
     — not "Administration". -->

## 1. Context

What part of the operating business this record belongs to, and why it is
written down rather than known.

An operations document exists because the fact is load-bearing and its holder
is mortal. Say what breaks if this is not written.

---

## 2. The record

The content: the terms, the identifiers, the counterparties, the dates.

Structured where structure exists — a table beats a paragraph for anything a
reader will look up rather than read.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| The thing | Its value, as of YYYY-MM-DD |

---

## 3. Validity

When this was true, and what would make it stale. An operational record with
no validity statement is trusted forever and correct for a quarter.

**As of:** YYYY-MM-DD. **Re-checked when:** the event that obliges re-reading.

---

## 4. Related

The adjacent records and the standards that govern them, named in prose.

<!--
NOTES ON USING THIS TEMPLATE — delete this block.

LICENCE. operations/ is not uniform. Commercial and legal records carry
LicenseRef-Numen-AllRightsReserved; the rest are CC-BY-4.0. The licence in the
frontmatter MUST match what REUSE.toml declares for the path you copy this to,
or `node scripts/check-license-frontmatter.mjs` fails. Check before you write.

`extraction_note` is for records lifted from another surface (the old web,
a PDF, a provider's console) and NOT edited afterwards. It is what tells a
later reader that the wording is the source's, not the archive's.

Sections 1-4 are required. §3 is the one that ages this document honestly.
