# SYS-NNN — The component

> **Summary:** One sentence. WHAT part of the live system this documents.
> **Epistemic:** How it works as wired today — components, flows, boundaries.
> **Pragmatic:** Use to onboard, audit, or plan a change to it.
> **Audience:** Agents · Oracles

<!-- Title: name the component and its state. "The deploy pipeline as it runs
     today" — not "Deployment". -->

> **A system document is a reference manual, not a plan.** It describes what
> exists. What could exist belongs in `blueprints/`; what must be built
> belongs in a mission.

## 1. Scope

Which part of the system this covers, and which adjacent parts it does not.

A reference whose scope is "the platform" will be read as authoritative about
whatever the reader was looking for, including the half it never examined.

---

## 2. How it works

The description. Components, their responsibilities, the flow between them,
and where each one lives — file paths, services, endpoints.

Concrete enough to act on: an agent should be able to find the code from this
document, not merely recognise it afterwards.

---

## 3. How to verify it

The commands that prove the description is still true — the build, the guard,
the health check, the query.

```
$ the command
what a healthy result looks like
```

This is what separates a reference from a memory. Without §3 the document
degrades silently and nobody can tell when it stopped being true.

---

## 4. Accuracy

What is known to be stale, incomplete, or unverified in this description, and
since when.

**Verified against:** `<sha>` or the environment, on YYYY-MM-DD.

An honest accuracy section is the price of being trusted at all. If the whole
document is current, say that, dated.

<!--
NOTES ON USING THIS TEMPLATE — delete this block.

`accuracy_warning` in the frontmatter is for a document reshelved or restored
whose content was knowingly NOT brought up to date. Do not use it to excuse a
new document from being correct.

system/ has no route of its own on the web: these documents surface through
the corpus mirror. That is deliberate — a reference is read by the people
maintaining the system, not by visitors.

Sections 1-4 are required. §3 and §4 are the two that decay first; write them
so the decay is visible.
