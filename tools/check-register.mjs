 * check-register.mjs — the register of checks is itself checked.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 *
 * STD-015 lists every practice this organisation holds itself to, and against
 * each one, the machine that checks it. That column was prose. Prose does not
 * fail. A cell could claim `[AUTO: gitleaks]` for months with no gitleaks in
 * the tree, and the register — the document whose entire job is to say what is
 * watched — was the one artefact nothing watched.
 *
 * Measured before this existed: of 29 rows claiming AUTO, 7 named a mechanism
 * that did not exist. Three further rows claimed MANUAL for work a guard had
 * been doing for weeks. A hand-written register drifts in both directions: it
 * over-promises, and it hides what you already built.
 *
 * WHAT A CHECK CELL MAY SAY
 *
 * Four forms, each verifiable. Anything else is a defect.
 *
 *   [AUTO: <path>]          a file in this tree does it. Must be tracked.
 *   [AUTO: npm <script>]    a package.json script does it. Must exist.
 *   [AUTO: scorecard <C>]   OpenSSF Scorecard does it. Needs scorecard.yml
 *                           and <C> must be a real Scorecard check name.
 *   [AUTO: github <path>]   a GitHub setting. Read over the API with
 *                           --github; without a credential it is UNKNOWN,
 *                           which is not the same as clean.
 *   [GATE: <auto-ref> → <human act>]
 *                           the machine verifies <auto-ref> in full; a person
 *                           performs the irreversible act. The machine half is
 *                           checked exactly like an AUTO cell — a gate whose
 *                           evidence is unverified is just a manual step with
 *                           better manners.
 *   [DEBT: <what is missing> — <owner>, <YYYY-MM-DD>]
 *                           nobody checks this yet. Must name who owes it and
 *                           when it was booked. Debt without an owner is a
 *                           wish.
 *
 * MANUAL is not a form. An organisation that runs itself does not get to
 * write "a person will remember".
 *
 * WHAT ELSE IT CHECKS
 *
 * TRC-006 says a guard is verified by its step in the job, never by the run's
 * colour — a green run and a workflow missing the guard are indistinguishable
 * from the conclusion. That row said MANUAL, and it is the one failure that
 * hides every other: silence and success look identical. Here it is mechanical.
 * A guard is discovered through scripts/blind-spots.json, so a rule file that
 * no registry entry names never runs, and the run is green for not looking.
 *
 *   node tools/check-register.mjs            local rows only (CI runs this)
 *   node tools/check-register.mjs --github   also the GitHub settings rows
 *   node tools/check-register.mjs --list     print the register as parsed
 *
 * Exit 0 every checked row holds · 1 a row is wrong or a mechanism is missing
 *      · 2 asked for GitHub rows and could not read them.
