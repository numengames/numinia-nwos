 * ruleset-export.mjs — the written-down branch protection, kept honest.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 * -----------------------
 * `.github/rulesets/protect-main.json` is a snapshot of the ruleset that
 * protects `main`. The panel is the source of truth; the file exists so the
 * setting can be read, diffed and reviewed in a pull request.
 *
 * A snapshot nobody compares is a claim nobody checks. This file drifted for
 * two weeks while stating the opposite of the live setting on the one
 * question that matters most — how many approvals `main` requires.
 *
 * Two subcommands:
 *
 *   node tools/ruleset-export.mjs           # rewrite the snapshot from the panel
 *   node tools/ruleset-export.mjs --check   # exit 1 if the snapshot has drifted
 *
 * WHY NOT `gh api ... > protect-main.json`
 * ----------------------------------------
 * That was the documented command and it is lossy in both directions. It
 * writes five transport fields that say nothing about the configuration
 * (`_links`, `node_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `current_user_can_bypass`),
 * and it DROPS `bypass_actors` — the API omits the key when the list is
 * empty, and an absent key reads as "unknown" where the file said "nobody".
 * "Nobody bypasses this" is the most important sentence the snapshot
 * contains, and the documented refresh command deleted it.
 *
 * WHAT --check CAN AND CANNOT DO
 * ------------------------------
 * It needs a credential that can read repository rulesets — admin scope. CI's
 * default token does not have it, so this does not run in the pipeline: it is
 * a command a person with the panel's own rights can run, and it answers in
 * one line instead of by reading two JSON files side by side. Without a
 * credential it says so and exits 2, which is neither pass nor fail: an
 * unanswered question is not a clean result.
