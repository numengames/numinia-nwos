/**
 * scripts/lib/rings.mjs — STD-004's three rings, in one place.
 *
 * MIS-145 v2 (2026-09-04). Until now this registry lived inside
 * the header guard (now guards/rules/std-004-the-header.mjs), which was correct while that guard was its only
 * consumer. check-templates.mjs is the second: it applies HDR-030's rule one step
 * earlier — at the mould instead of at the documents copied from it — and a
 * second private copy of the registry is exactly the drift MIS-138 D1.1 moved
 * the vocabularies into rules.json to stop.
 *
 * Same reasoning, one difference: this registry stays as code rather than
 * moving into rules.json, because every entry here carries the comment that
 * says WHY a field was registered and by which decision. Those comments are
 * the record; JSON would drop them.
