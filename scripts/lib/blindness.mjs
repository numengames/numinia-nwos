// blindness — D-025: every guard declares what it cannot see, in its own
// output, on success as well as failure.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// A green result answers "did what I check pass?" and is read as "is the
// repository sound?". The gap between those two questions is exactly the size
// of the blind spot, and until now it was never printed. Three separate debt
// entries are instances of that gap:
//
//   D-039  a green ratchet certified 85 corrupted files
//   D-047  the reference resolver is blind to the folder in a path
//   D-049  the enumerators are blind to untracked files
//
// The knowledge already existed in the scripts. It never reached the reader.
//
// HOW TO USE
// ----------
//   import { declareBlindSpots } from './lib/blindness.mjs';
//   declareBlindSpots('check-references');
//
// Call it once, near the top. It registers an exit hook, so the declaration
// prints on every path out of the process — including `process.exit(1)` from
// inside a failure branch, which is where a reader is least likely to go
// looking for it and most likely to need it.
//
// WHAT IT IS BLIND TO (this module included, D-025 applies to itself):
// it prints what the registry claims. It cannot check that the claim is
// complete — that a guard has no blind spot nobody thought of. The test suite
// verifies the claims that ARE made; it cannot verify the ones that are not.
