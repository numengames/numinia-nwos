// check-internal-links.mjs — every internal href must resolve to a built page.
//
// Why this guard exists (2026-08-31): `main` shipped a section index that
// returned 404. ADR-035 opened `system/`, the collection was declared, the
// three SYS documents built and the retired /blueprints/* addresses were
// redirected to them — and CI was green through all of it, because every
// existing guard was blind to this class of failure:
//
//   · check-url-lifecycle only asks whether a URL that USED to exist still
//     answers. /corpus/system/ never existed, so its absence was not a death.
//   · check-orphan-content asks whether content passed through the renderer,
//     not whether the pages that link to it resolve.
//   · astro build cannot fail on a link, only on a route.
//
// The gap is structural: a folder can be published document by document while
// the address a reader would actually type — the section index — is never
// built. This guard closes it by reading the output the way a browser does:
// follow every href, demand a file at the other end.
//
// It resolves against web/dist, so redirects (emitted as real HTML files by
// Astro) count as valid targets without parsing astro.config.
//
// BLIND TO (D-025):
//   · external links — it never leaves the filesystem
//   · whether the page at the other end is the RIGHT page, only that one exists
//   · hrefs built at runtime by JavaScript
//   · anchors (#fragment) — the file is checked, the fragment is not
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-internal-links.mjs
