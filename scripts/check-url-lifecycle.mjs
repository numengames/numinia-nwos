/**
 * check-url-lifecycle.mjs — the URL ratchet (D-028, ADR-033, P-010 §5).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 * -----------------------
 * `numinia.org` derives most of its addresses from a filename or a
 * frontmatter `id`. Deleting a document therefore deletes a public URL,
 * silently, and nothing noticed. D-028 has been open since 2026-08-25 with
 * the evidence: `/corpus/canon/c-006-manual-juego-de-rol/` (890 KB) died in
 * April and was found months later.
 *
 * P-010 §5 answered this with a prohibition — "supersede, never delete" —
 * which stops the deletion but never pays the debt: it made deleting a
 * governance question when it is a routing question. ADR-033 replaces the
 * prohibition with this instrument: a document may be deleted when its
 * consumers are zero or redirected, and THIS is what verifies "redirected".
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS — the same ratchet pattern as lint-naming.mjs
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * `scripts/url-baseline.json` is the manifest of every URL the site
 * published at the last accepted build. After a build:
 *
 *   - a URL in the baseline that is no longer built, and has no redirect
 *     rule in `web/astro.config.mjs` pointing away from it  →  FAILURE.
 *     That is a dead address, which is exactly D-028's finding.
 *   - a URL that disappeared but IS redirected  →  accepted, and the
 *     baseline is updated on the next --write-baseline.
 *   - new URLs  →  always fine. The ratchet only guards disappearance.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-url-lifecycle.mjs                  # verify vs baseline
 *   node scripts/check-url-lifecycle.mjs --report         # full detail, exit 0
 *   node scripts/check-url-lifecycle.mjs --write-baseline # freeze current state
 *   node scripts/check-url-lifecycle.mjs --propose        # emit the redirect
 *                                                         # lines a deletion needs
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED — how a redirect actually satisfies this guard
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Verified 2026-08-31 by deleting `reports/audits/AUD-2026-08-26-complexity.md`
 * against a real build: `npm run build` stayed GREEN while losing two pages
 * (660 → 658), which is precisely the blindness D-028 records. This guard
 * failed on it, correctly.
 *
 * On adding the redirect rule and rebuilding, the guard passed — but NOT via
 * the `covered` branch below. Astro MATERIALISES each redirect as a real
 * `index.html` at the old address (`<meta http-equiv="refresh" url=/audits>`),
 * so the URL never leaves `dist/` at all: it stops being a document and starts
 * being a signpost. The address keeps resolving, which is the promise being
 * guarded, so the outcome is right — but the mechanism is Astro's, not this
 * script's. The `covered` branch therefore only fires for redirects declared
 * outside the Astro config (a CDN or host-level rule), and is kept for that
 * case rather than as the main path. Stated here because a reader who assumes
 * the main path is the config-parsing one would misjudge what this guard
 * proves.
 *
 * WHY IT READS web/dist AND NOT THE .astro SOURCES
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Every route derives its slug differently: `missions/[id].astro` uses the
 * frontmatter `id` lowercased, `audits/[id].astro` uses the Astro loader's
 * entry id, `corpus/[...slug].astro` uses a filename-derived id from
 * getPublicCorpus(). Re-implementing that derivation in this script would be
 * a second source of truth that drifts — the exact failure P-010 §3.2.2 was
 * corrected for, where an inference about [...slug].astro was replaced by a
 * measurement against real built output. So: this guard measures the build.
 * If it did not run, it says so and fails rather than passing vacuously.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT CHECK (D-025 — declare your blindness):
 * see scripts/blind-spots.json, entry "check-url-lifecycle". Printed on
 * every exit path.
