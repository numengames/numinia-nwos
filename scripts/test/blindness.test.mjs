// blindness.test.mjs — D-025 closure condition 3.
//
// "The blind spots are verified by test, not asserted — a guard claiming to
//  see .ts files is checked against a .ts file that breaks."
//
// A declared blind-spot list nobody verified is a claim about coverage with
// the shape of evidence. This suite makes each claim falsifiable:
//
//   STRUCTURAL  every guard in CI has a registry entry; every registry entry
//               points at a script that exists and actually imports the
//               declaration module. Catches a guard added without declaring,
//               and a declaration for a guard that was deleted.
//
//   BEHAVIOURAL the declaration is printed on SUCCESS, not only on failure.
//               That was the whole complaint: green is when the reader most
//               needs to know what was not checked.
//
//   FIXTURE     the interesting blind spots are PROVEN. A file that should
//               trip the guard is built in a scratch clone, the guard is run,
//               and the test asserts the guard stays green — demonstrating
//               the blindness is real and the declaration is honest.
//
// Run: npm test
